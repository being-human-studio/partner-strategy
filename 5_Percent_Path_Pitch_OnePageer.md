## Four Pathways to Earn Your 5%

### 💰 Pathway 1: Capital Raising (Fastest Path)

| Capital Raised via Your Intros | Earnout Earned | Total Equity |
|-------------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| $500,000 | +0.5% | **2.0%** |
| $1,000,000 | +1.0% | **3.0%** |
| $2,000,000 | +1.5% | **4.5%** |
| $3,000,000 | +0.5% | **5.0%** ✓ |

**Example:** You introduce BH to 2-3 VCs who collectively invest $1.5M → You earn 2.75% total (1.5% base + 1.25% earnout)

---

### 🤝 Pathway 2: Deal Sourcing

| Deals Sourced That BH Signs | Earnout Earned | Total Equity |
|-----------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 2 deals ($200K+ each) | +0.5% | **2.0%** |
| 4 deals | +1.0% | **3.0%** |
| 6 deals | +1.5% | **4.5%** |
| 8 deals | +0.5% | **5.0%** ✓ |

**Example:** You introduce 4 venture opportunities that become BH engagements worth $150K+ each → You earn 3.0% total

### 📈 Pathway 3: Revenue Generation

| Revenue from Your Customer Intros | Earnout Earned | Total Equity |
|----------------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| $500,000 | +0.5% | **2.0%** |
| $1,000,000 | +1.0% | **3.0%** |
| $2,000,000 | +1.5% | **4.5%** |
| $3,000,000 | +0.5% | **5.0%** ✓ |

**Example:** You introduce customers who purchase $1.2M in WonderCast subscriptions → You earn 3.2% total

| Partnership Type | Earnout Earned | Example |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Fremantle Distribution Deal** | +1.5% | Global distribution for WonderCast |

## You Can Combine Pathways!

**Real-World Scenario:**

```
Year 1:
├─ Base vests (50%): 0.75%
├─ Raise $750K capital: +1.0%
└─ Source 1 deal: +0.25%
   TOTAL: 2.0%

Year 2:
├─ Base vests (50%): +0.75%
├─ Raise $1M more capital: +1.0%
├─ Fremantle partnership: +1.0%
└─ Customer revenue $300K: +0.5%
   TOTAL: 5.25% → Capped at 5.0% ✓
```

**Result:** You achieve 5% by delivering $2M capital + 1 deal + major partnership + $300K revenue
**BH Gets:** $3M+ value for $600K equity cost = **5x ROI**

## Why This is Better Than a Flat 5% Grant

### ❌ If BH Just Gives You 5% Upfront

- **Risk:** You might not deliver, BH can't take it back
- **Impact:** 39% of BH's Growth Pool consumed
- **Result:** BH can't afford tech advisors + capital partners needed for success

### ✅ If You Earn 5% Through Performance

- **Risk:** Zero - you only get equity by delivering results
- **Flexibility:** BH can preserve equity if you don't deliver
- **Upside:** If you earn 5%, BH got $3M+ value = massive win
- **Alignment:** Perfect incentives - we both win when milestones hit

---

## Key Benefits for You

### 1. You Control Your Destiny
Performance drives equity, not politics. Deliver results = Earn equity.

### 2. Fast Vesting (Not Time-Based)
Raise $1M in month 6? You earn 1% immediately. No waiting for time-based vesting.

### 3. Multiple Paths
Pick your strengths. Focus on capital raising? Great. Better at deal sourcing? That works too.

### 4. Clear Scorecard
Quarterly tracking shows exactly where you stand and what's needed to reach 5%.

### 5. Unlimited Upside
If you deliver beyond 5% worth of value, we can structure bonuses, venture equity, or other rewards.

## The Math: 10x Value Ratio

**Every earnout dollar requires ~$10 of value delivered:**

| You Earn | Equity Cost (at $12M) | Value You Deliver | Ratio |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|-------|
| +0.5% | $60,000 | $500,000 | 8.3x |
| +1.0% | $120,000 | $1,000,000 | 8.3x |
| +1.5% | $180,000 | $1,800,000 | 10x |
| +3.5% (full earnout) | $420,000 | $3,000,000+ | 7x+ |

**Why this matters:** BH is thrilled to give you 5% if you deliver $3M+ value. That's a massive win for the studio.

## Timeline Expectations

### Months 1-6: Foundation
- Base equity cliff vesting
- Map network, identify opportunities
- First introductions made

### Months 7-12: First Earnouts
- **Target:** At least 1 earnout milestone achieved
- Example: First $500K capital raised, or 2 deals sourced

### Months 13-24: Acceleration
- **Target:** 3-4% total equity achieved
- Early intros compound, strategic partnerships close
- Momentum building

### Months 25-36: Full 5%
- **Target:** Approaching or achieving 5% cap
- Sustained performance, deep integration with BH strategy

**No Deadline:** Earnout has no expiration. Achieve milestones in year 1 or year 3, doesn't matter.

## FAQ (Quick Answers)

**Q: What if we don't hit 5%?**
A: You still earn 2-3% for being good advisors (base + some earnouts). That's fair compensation. The 5% is reserved for transformational performance.

**Q: What if we hit 5% in year 1?**
A: Amazing! You vest immediately and we discuss post-5% structures (bonuses, venture equity, carried interest in future BH funds).

**Q: Who decides if we earned an earnout?**
A: Formulas are automatic (capital/revenue = math). Strategic partnerships require board approval, but criteria are clear (>$500K value, unique to you, transformational).

**Q: Can we negotiate the formulas?**
A: Yes! If you have data showing different value ratios make sense, we're open. The principle (10x value) stays, but exact math is flexible.
