- If BHP spins out AI Playground as separate venture, BH receives equity stake

## Combined Deal Structure (Recommended)

### The Trade

| Party | Provides | Receives | Economic Value |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Beach House Pictures** | Storyteller in Residence (S$400K over 24 months) | 2.5% Being Human equity OR SAFE for $300K at $12M cap | $300K USD |
| **Being Human** | AI Playground Consultation (S$200K over 24 months) | $50K cash + 10% AI Playground venture equity (if spun out) | S$200K value |

### Net Economics

- BHP provides S$400K value, receives $300K equity value in BH = **BHP contributes net S$100K value**
- BH provides S$200K value, receives S$200K value (cash + potential equity) = **Neutral exchange**

**Adjustment Needed:** To make truly equivalent, either:
1. BH increases AI playground services to S$400K value (doubling scope)
2. BHP equity reduced to 1.85% (S$300K value)
3. BHP pays S$100K cash + receives 2.5% equity

## Performance-Gated Vesting Schedule

To align with BH's performance-based partnership model, recommend vesting BHP's equity based on service delivery:

### BHP Equity Vesting (2.5% total)

| Tranche | % of Total | Timeline | Milestone Trigger |
|---------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Cliff | 25% (0.625%) | Month 6 | WonderCast launch package delivered and approved |
| T2 | 25% (0.625%) | Month 12 | Luminary brand development completed + measurable WonderCast content engagement |
| T3 | 25% (0.625%) | Month 18 | BH studio brand content delivered + sustained performance |
| T4 | 25% (0.625%) | Month 24 | Year 2 deliverables complete + portfolio-level brand impact |

**Acceleration Trigger:** If BHP content directly contributes to venture exit or $1M+ funding round, accelerate 50% of remaining unvested equity

### BH Equity Vesting (AI Playground Venture - 10% example)

| Tranche | % of Total | Timeline | Milestone Trigger |
|---------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Cash Payment | N/A | Months 1-3 | $50K paid upon Phase 1 strategy delivery |
| Cliff | 25% (2.5%) | Month 6 | Product strategy and roadmap delivered, BHP commits to building venture |
| T2 | 25% (2.5%) | Month 12 | Product development guidance through beta launch |
| T3 | 25% (2.5%) | Month 18 | Implementation support through pilot program |
| T4 | 25% (2.5%) | Month 24 | GTM strategy and venture achieves first revenue OR funding |

**Acceleration Trigger:** If AI Playground venture exits or raises $2M+ within 24 months, accelerate all remaining equity

---

## Scenario Analysis

### Scenario 1: Both Deliver, AI Playground Becomes Venture

- **BHP receives:** 2.5% Being Human equity (value at BH exit)
- **BH receives:** $50K cash + 10% AI Playground venture equity (value at venture exit)
- **Outcome:** Both parties aligned on each other's success

### Scenario 2: Both Deliver, AI Playground Doesn't Spin Out

- **BHP receives:** 2.5% Being Human equity
- **BH receives:** $50K cash only (underpaid for S$200K value delivered)
- **Mitigation:** Add clause that if AI Playground doesn't spin out within 18 months, BHP pays remaining S$150K cash OR BH's equity stake increases to 3.5%

### Scenario 3: BHP Under-Delivers on Storytelling

- **BHP receives:** Only vested equity based on milestones achieved (e.g., 50% delivered = 1.25% equity)
- **BH receives:** Pro-rata reduction in obligations (50% delivered = only owe $25K cash + 5% venture equity)

### Scenario 4: Partnership Leads to Joint Venture

- **BHP + BH co-found AI Playground venture**
- BH's consultation services convert to co-founder equity (e.g., 30-40% of venture)
- BHP's production expertise + BH's AI capabilities = differentiated offering
- Storyteller in Residence services continue as separate arrangement (BHP still earns BH equity)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### For Being Human

**Risk:** BHP under-delivers on storytelling quality or timeliness
- *Mitigation:* Performance-gated vesting with clear acceptance criteria; BH can withhold equity tranches if deliverables not approved

**Risk:** 2.5% equity is over-payment if storytelling doesn't drive measurable impact
- *Mitigation:* Include impact-based acceleration/reduction clauses; benchmark against market rates for similar services

**Risk:** AI Playground venture never materializes, BH over-delivers for $50K only
- *Mitigation:* Minimum cash payment clause OR BH equity stake adjustment if venture doesn't spin out

### For Beach House Pictures

**Risk:** BH under-delivers on AI consultation or venture doesn't launch
- *Mitigation:* $50K cash covers Phase 1 strategy regardless; only deeper work tied to venture equity

**Risk:** 2.5% BH equity is illiquid and may not be worth S$400K value provided
- *Mitigation:* Include liquidity rights (e.g., BHP can sell equity in secondary transaction after 24 months) OR SAFE structure that converts at liquidity event

**Risk:** Fremantle doesn't approve equity exchange deal
- *Mitigation:* Get Fremantle approval upfront before finalizing; alternative cash structure if equity not approved

---

## Fremantle Approval Requirements

Since BHP is Fremantle subsidiary, any equity exchange requires corporate parent approval:

**Required Approvals:**
1. **Fremantle Legal:** Review equity exchange agreement for compliance
2. **Fremantle Finance:** Approve valuation methodology and accounting treatment
3. **Fremantle Corporate Development:** Ensure no conflicts with other Fremantle partnerships or ventures

**Approval Timeline:** Likely 30-60 days for Fremantle review process

**Contingency:** Structure as conditional agreement pending Fremantle approval; if not approved, revert to cash payment structure

---

## Recommended Deal Terms

### Equity Exchange Agreement

**Beach House Pictures Equity:**
- **Stake:** 2.5% Being Human studio equity
- **Instrument:** SAFE at $12M cap (converts at next priced round) OR direct equity
- **Vesting:** 24 months, performance-gated milestones
- **Services:** Storyteller in Residence as defined (S$400K value)
- **Termination:** Either party can terminate with 90 days notice; unvested equity forfeited

**Being Human Equity (if AI Playground spins out):**

- **Equity Stake:** 10% AI Playground venture equity (if venture materializes)
- **Vesting:** 24 months, performance-gated milestones
- **Services:** Generative AI Playground consultation as defined (S$200K value)

### Governance and Control

**Being Human:**
- No board seat or voting rights for BHP (minority stake)

## Alternative Structures

### Alternative 1: Jocelyn & Donovan Personal Equity + BHP Corporate Services

Instead of BHP corporate receiving equity, structure as:
- **Jocelyn & Donovan:** 2.5% combined personal advisory equity (separate from BHP corporate)
- **BHP Corporate:** Paid cash S$400K for storytelling services (separate contract)
- **BH → BHP:** AI consultation as described above

**Pros:** Cleaner separation between personal and corporate relationships
**Cons:** Jocelyn/Donovan's request was 5%, not 2.5%; still need to address their ask

### Alternative 2: Hybrid Advisory + Corporate

- **Jocelyn & Donovan Personal:** 1.5% combined advisory equity (unrelated to services)
- **BHP Corporate:** 1.0% equity for storytelling services (separate from personal advisory)
- **Total:** 2.5% combined, but split between personal and corporate

**Pros:** Recognizes both personal advisory value and corporate service value
**Cons:** Complex to administer; risk of confusion between two equity grants

### Alternative 3: Revenue Share Instead of Equity

- **BHP receives:** 5% revenue share from WonderCast and Luminary (ventures they provide storytelling for)
- **Duration:** 3 years or until S$400K paid out, whichever comes first
- **BH → BHP:** Cash or venture equity as described

**Pros:** Aligns BHP directly with venture success; no studio equity dilution
**Cons:** Only works if ventures generate revenue; BHP prefers equity upside

---

## Next Steps

1. **Validate Services Scope**
   - Confirm BHP can deliver storytelling services as outlined
   - Confirm BH can deliver AI playground consultation with existing team capacity

2. **Agree on Valuations**
   - Is $12M cap appropriate for Being Human current stage?
   - What would AI Playground venture be valued at if it spins out?

3. **Fremantle Approval**
   - BHP to seek Fremantle approval for equity exchange structure
   - Timeline: 30-60 days

4. **Legal Documentation**
   - Equity exchange agreement with performance milestones
   - Service level agreements for both parties
   - IP ownership and usage rights
   - Termination and dispute resolution clauses

5. **Jocelyn & Donovan 5% Request**
   - Address separately from BHP corporate deal
   - Evaluate against broader cap table strategy (see Part 2 analysis)

---

## Conclusion

The updated deal structure trades services for equity, eliminating cash transactions while creating long-term alignment. Recommended approach:

- **BHP receives:** 2.5% BH equity via SAFE at $12M cap, vesting over 24 months based on storytelling service delivery
- **BH receives:** $50K cash + 10% AI Playground venture equity (if spins out), with backstop clause if venture doesn't materialize

This structure:
- ✅ Aligns incentives (both invested in each other's success)
- ✅ Eliminates cash constraints (services for equity)
- ✅ Performance-gated (earn equity by delivering)
- ✅ Preserves future venture opportunity (AI Playground partnership)
- ✅ Mitigates key risks (backstop clauses, Fremantle approval contingency)

**Critical Decision:** Does 2.5% equity dilution fit within BH's broader cap table strategy? See Cap Table Framework analysis to evaluate.
