## Talking Points for Jocelyn & Donovan Discussion

**Purpose:** One-page guide for Kyle to use in counter-offer conversation
**Date:** February 1, 2026

---

## Opening Frame

**Set collaborative, strategic tone:**

> "We're excited about partnering with Beach House. You bring world-class storytelling expertise that fills a critical gap for Being Human's ventures. We've done deep analysis on how to structure this partnership to maximize value for both sides while ensuring we can build the complete partner portfolio BH needs to succeed. Let me walk you through our thinking."

## The Counter-Offer (Lead with This)

**Our Recommendation:**

| Element | Our Offer | Their Request | Gap |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| **BHP Corporate Services** | 2.5% BH equity | Storytelling ↔ AI consultation trade | Aligned |
| **Jocelyn Personal Advisory** | 0.4% BH equity | Part of 5% combined request | -2.1% |
| **Donovan Personal Advisory** | 0% studio / 1-1.5% per media venture | Part of 5% combined request | Different structure |
| **TOTAL STUDIO EQUITY** | **2.9%** | **7.5%** (2.5% BHP + 5% personal) | **-4.6%** |

**Presentation:**
> "We'd like to offer three distinct components:
> 1. **Beach House Pictures Corporate:** 2.5% BH equity in exchange for storytelling services (valued at S$400K over 24 months). This recognizes BHP's Emmy-level production expertise and Fremantle distribution leverage.
> 2. **Jocelyn Personal Advisory:** 0.4% BH equity as Strategic Advisor, focusing on business development, strategic partnerships, and operational guidance - separate from BHP corporate services.
> 3. **Donovan Venture-Specific:** Instead of studio equity, we'd like to offer significant equity in WonderCast (1.0%) and Luminary (1.25%) where your creative vision will be most impactful. This aligns your upside directly with ventures you'll shape creatively.
>
> Combined, this is a meaningful package with significant upside, while preserving our ability to bring in the tech advisors, investor networks, and enterprise partners we need to complete our portfolio."

## Key Messages (If They Push Back)

### Message 1: We Need to Build a Balanced Portfolio

**Their Objection:** "5% seems reasonable for the value we bring."

**Your Response:**
> "I absolutely agree you bring tremendous value. The challenge is our overall cap table strategy. We have a 15-20% Growth Pool for ALL partners and advisors across all types - tech advisors, capital partners, enterprise distribution, domain experts. If we allocate 7.5% to one relationship cluster (BHP corporate + you both personally), that's 37-50% of our total partner budget.
>
> We still need to bring in:
> - Tech/AI advisors with access to AI investor networks (solving our #1 constraint: capital access)
> - Capital partners with LP relationships (investors we can't reach directly)
> - Enterprise GTM partners for B2B ventures like Kavlo
> - Domain experts in education and other verticals
>
> The 2.9% studio equity we're offering, combined with Donovan's venture-specific equity, reflects the mid-range for strategic advisors in our framework while preserving our ability to build the complete partner ecosystem BH needs."

### Message 2: Your Networks Overlap (Married Co-Founders)

**Their Objection:** "We should each get separate equity since we bring different expertise."

**Your Response:**
> "I respect that you bring complementary skills - Jocelyn's business development and operations expertise is distinct from Donovan's creative excellence. However, your networks overlap significantly since you're married co-founders of the same company. The Fremantle relationships, Netflix partnerships, broadcaster networks - these are shared assets.
>
> In our evaluation framework, we score 'Uniqueness' - whether a partner brings networks we don't have or overlaps with existing partners. When we compared your networks, there's 90%+ overlap. That's not a criticism - it's natural for co-founders. But it means we'd be paying twice for access to the same relationships if we allocated equity to you independently.
>
> The 0.4% for Jocelyn recognizes her distinct business development skills, while Donovan's venture-specific equity recognizes his creative contributions where they're most valuable - directly shaping the products."

### Message 3: Venture-Specific is Potentially More Valuable

**Their Objection:** "We'd prefer studio equity, not venture-specific."

**Your Response:**
> "I understand the preference for studio equity - it's broader exposure. But consider the upside: if Donovan's creative vision helps make WonderCast or Luminary a breakout success, 1-1.5% of a $50M+ venture is worth far more than 0.5% of the studio.
>
> Studio equity is diluted across all ventures - winners and losers. Venture-specific equity concentrates your upside in ventures where you have the most impact. And for media ventures specifically, Donovan's creative expertise is core to the product, not just nice-to-have.
>
> We're essentially saying: 'We believe your creative contributions to WonderCast and Luminary will be so valuable that we want you to have significant equity in those specific ventures.' That's a vote of confidence, not a downgrade."

### Message 4: BHP Corporate + Personal Advisory Can Be Separated

**Their Objection:** "The BHP corporate deal should include our personal advisory equity."

**Your Response:**
> "We see these as two distinct relationships that can succeed independently:
>
> 1. **BHP Corporate Partnership:** Beach House Pictures (the company) provides storytelling services, receives equity. This is a corporate service exchange - BHP delivers, BHP gets compensated.
>
> 2. **Personal Advisory:** You (Jocelyn and Donovan as individuals) provide strategic guidance, introductions, and expertise that goes beyond what BHP delivers corporately. This is compensated separately.
>
> Why separate them? Because if one relationship doesn't work out, the other can continue. If BHP gets too busy with Fremantle priorities and can't deliver on storytelling services, you can still continue as personal advisors. And vice versa.
>
> It also creates clearer accountability - we know what we're getting from BHP corporate (production deliverables) vs. what we're getting from you personally (strategic introductions, business development)."

## If They Still Insist on 5%

### Fallback Position 1: Performance-Based Earnout

**Offer:**
> "I want to find a path to yes here. What if we structured it with a base and earnout?
>
> - **Base:** 2.5% studio equity (BHP 2.5% + you split it or we allocate 1.5% Jocelyn / 1% Donovan)
> - **Earnout:** Up to 2.5% additional equity based on performance milestones:
>   - +0.5% for every $500K capital raised through your investor introductions
>   - +0.5% for every 2 signed BH engagements sourced through your networks
>   - +0.5% for achieving 3x baseline brand awareness (measurable via media coverage, inbound)
>
> This gives you a path to the full 5% you're requesting, but you earn it by delivering exceptional results. If you truly can deliver the value you believe, you'll get the equity. It perfectly aligns our incentives."

### Fallback Position 2: Compromise at 3.5%

**Offer:**
> "Let me propose a middle ground: 3.5% combined studio equity structured as:
> - **BHP Corporate:** 2.5% for storytelling services (as planned)
> - **Jocelyn Personal:** 0.75% strategic advisor equity
> - **Donovan Personal:** 0.25% studio equity PLUS 1.0% WonderCast + 1.25% Luminary venture equity
>
> Total studio dilution: 3.5% (vs. 2.9% our recommendation, vs. 7.5% full request)
>
> This is a meaningful compromise that recognizes your value while preserving ~12% of Growth Pool for other critical partners (tech advisors, capital partners)."

### Fallback Position 3: Walk Away (If They Won't Budge)

**Frame:**
> "I deeply respect what you've built at Beach House and the value you'd bring to Being Human. However, we need to be disciplined about our cap table strategy. At 5% combined personal equity plus 2.5% corporate, we'd be allocating nearly half our Growth Pool to one relationship cluster. That would force us to choose between tech advisors OR capital partners - we couldn't afford both well.
>
> Given our #1 constraint is capital access (investor networks, LPs) and #2 is deal flow (venture opportunities), we need to prioritize equity for partners who solve those constraints first. Your primary strength is Distribution/GTM (#3 constraint).
>
> I'd love to keep the BHP corporate partnership at 2.5% for storytelling services - that's high value regardless. But for the personal advisory component, we'd need to revisit when we have more budget capacity, or structure it differently (revenue share, project fees, smaller equity stake). What would make sense?"

## Strengths to Emphasize (Build Rapport)

**Acknowledge their value:**

1. **Emmy-Level Excellence:** "Your Emmy nomination for Mind Your Manners and 200M+ views on China From Above demonstrate world-class storytelling ability that BH ventures absolutely need."

2. **Fremantle Leverage:** "The Fremantle acquisition positions you as a gateway to global distribution that would take us years to build independently. That's incredibly valuable."

3. **Complementary Skills:** "Jocelyn, your operational excellence in building two production companies and navigating the Fremantle acquisition brings business development expertise we genuinely value. Donovan, your creative vision and narrative structure mastery is exactly what our AI-powered storytelling ventures need."

4. **Cultural Fit:** "You're entrepreneurial, you understand building from scratch, and you're interested in the AI-media convergence where BH operates. That alignment is rare and valuable."

---

## Risks to Address Proactively

**Don't wait for them to bring up, address upfront:**

1. **"Is BH valued at $12M?"**
   - "The $12M cap comes from our SAFE structure for investors. It's a valuation cap, not a current valuation. As we hit milestones (WonderCast launch, Luminary fundraise, portfolio growth), that cap could look conservative. You're getting in early at favorable terms."

2. **"What if BHP corporate partnership ends?"**
   - "Your personal advisory equity is separate and vests independently. Even if BHP can't deliver storytelling services (Fremantle priorities, capacity issues, etc.), your personal equity continues to vest based on your individual milestones."

3. **"What if ventures fail?"**
   - "That's the nature of venture studios - some ventures succeed, others don't. Studio equity gives you exposure to the whole portfolio. Venture-specific equity concentrates your upside in ventures where you have most impact. It's a risk/reward tradeoff. For Donovan specifically, we're betting his creative contributions make WonderCast/Luminary more likely to succeed, not less."

4. **"What about dilution in future rounds?"**
   - "Everyone gets diluted pro-rata in future funding rounds - founders, advisors, investors. But as a SAFE holder or early equity recipient, you're in ahead of later-stage investors at a lower valuation. Standard in venture world."

## Handling Specific Scenarios

### Scenario: "Let's start with 5% and renegotiate later"

**Response:**
> "I appreciate the willingness to be flexible, but equity doesn't work that way. Once we grant it and you start vesting, we can't take it back. That's why we need to be strategic upfront. We can always give MORE equity later if you over-deliver (that's what acceleration clauses are for). But we can't reduce it once granted.
>
> That's exactly why we're proposing performance-gated milestones - you earn equity by delivering outcomes, not by promises. If you smash our expectations, acceleration kicks in and you vest faster. If we both agree later that the relationship warrants more equity, we can grant additional. But we need to start at a level that preserves our strategic flexibility."

### Scenario: "Other advisors get 1-2% each, why not us?"

**Response:**
> "Good question - let me explain our framework. The 0.5-1.5% range for strategic advisors assumes:
> 1. They bring unique networks (low overlap with other partners)
> 2. They're solving our highest-priority constraints (capital access, deal flow)
> 3. It's one person, one equity grant
>
> In your case:
> 1. You share 90%+ networks (married co-founders)
> 2. You primarily solve Distribution (#3 priority, not #1-2)
> 3. We're also giving 2.5% to BHP corporate for services
>
> If we treated you as two completely independent advisors with no overlap and no corporate deal, yes - we'd offer 0.75-1.0% each. But when we account for overlap and the BHP corporate equity, the combined package needs adjustment.
>
> The total package (2.9% studio + venture-specific) is actually competitive with what we'd offer two independent advisors, just structured differently to reflect the BHP relationship."

### Scenario: "We'll walk if you don't meet our ask"

**Response:**
> "I respect that you need to make the right decision for yourselves. We'd genuinely love to partner - the fit is strong and the value is real. But we also need to be honest about our constraints.
>
> At 5% combined personal plus 2.5% corporate, we'd be choosing between you and the tech/capital partners who solve our #1 priority (fundraising). That's not a choice we can make lightly.
>
> Let me ask: What's most important to you about the 5%? Is it:
> - The upside potential? (We can structure venture-specific to be higher)
> - The validation/recognition? (We absolutely recognize your value - the total package reflects that)
> - The influence/involvement? (Equity % doesn't determine involvement level)
> - Something else?
>
> If we understand what's driving the ask, we might find creative structure that works for both sides without over-allocating our Growth Pool."

## Closing Strategy

### If Agreement Reached

**Next Steps:**
1. "Let me draft term sheets for each component (BHP corporate, Jocelyn advisory, Donovan venture-specific if applicable)"
2. "We'll need Fremantle approval on the BHP corporate equity exchange - can you help facilitate that internally?"
3. "Target to have agreements signed within 30 days so we can start collaborating on WonderCast launch"
4. "Welcome to the Being Human partner family - excited to build together"

### If No Agreement

**Leave Door Open:**
> "I understand this structure doesn't meet your requirements. I want to keep the relationship positive and leave the door open. A few options:
>
> 1. **BHP Corporate Only:** We move forward with the 2.5% equity for storytelling services (no personal advisory component). This still delivers tremendous value to both sides.
>
> 2. **Revisit in 6 Months:** We execute BHP corporate partnership, see how collaboration goes, and revisit personal advisory equity once we've built trust and validated the working relationship.
>
> 3. **Alternative Structure:** Instead of equity, we could structure revenue share or project fees for your personal contributions. Less upside, but also less tied to BH's cap table constraints.
>
> What feels right to you?"
