# Jocelyn & Donovan - Path to 5% Personal Equity
## Performance-Based Earnout Structure

**Date:** February 1, 2026
**Principle:** You can earn 5%, but only by delivering value worth 10x the equity cost

---

## Key Context

### Why This Structure Matters

**Beach House Pictures (Corporate):**
- Owned by Fremantle (not Jocelyn & Donovan personally)
- Service exchange equity (0.83%) benefits Fremantle corporate
- Less aligned with J&D's personal incentives

**Jocelyn & Donovan (Personal):**
- Want 5% personal equity (separate from BHP corporate)
- Direct ownership, direct upside
- Personal alignment with BH's success

**Being Human's Challenge:**
- 5% personal + 0.83% corporate = 5.83% total dilution
- That's 39% of our 15% Growth Pool
- Limits capacity for tech advisors, capital partners who solve higher-priority constraints

**The Solution:**
Structure where J&D CAN achieve 5% personal equity, but ONLY if they deliver results that make BH 10x+ better off than the equity cost.

---

## The Earnout Structure

### Two-Tier Model: Base + Performance Earnout

```
Total Potential Personal Equity: 5.0%
├── Base Allocation: 1.5% (for being excellent advisors)
└── Performance Earnout: 3.5% (for delivering transformational value)
```

**How It Works:**
- Start with meaningful base equity (1.5% combined)
- Earn additional 3.5% through specific, measurable milestones
- Each earnout tranche requires delivering value worth 10x+ the equity awarded
- Total can reach their 5% target, but only through exceptional performance

---

## Base Allocation: 1.5% (Guaranteed if Standard Performance)

### Jocelyn: 1.0% Studio Equity

**Role:** Strategic Advisor - Business Development & Operational Excellence

**Base Vesting Schedule (24 months):**

| Tranche | % | Timeline | Milestone |

**What This Covers:**
- Strategic creative direction for BH ventures
- Brand positioning and narrative frameworks
- Content quality standards and guidance
- Portfolio-level creative strategy

---

## Performance Earnout: 3.5% (Earn by Delivering Exceptional Value)

### The Value Exchange Principle

**For BH to award earnout equity, the delivered value must be ≥10x the equity cost:**

```
Equity Cost (at $12M valuation):
- 0.5% = $60,000
- 1.0% = $120,000
- 1.5% = $180,000

Required Value Delivered:
- For 0.5% earnout → Deliver $600,000+ value
- For 1.0% earnout → Deliver $1,200,000+ value
- For 1.5% earnout → Deliver $1,800,000+ value
```

**Types of Value That Count:**
1. **Capital Raised** - Investor intros that convert to committed capital
2. **Deals Sourced** - Venture opportunities that become BH engagements
3. **Revenue Generated** - Customer/partner intros that produce revenue
4. **Strategic Partnerships** - Major partnerships that create ongoing value

---

## Earnout Pathways: Multiple Ways to Achieve 5%

### Pathway 1: Capital Raising Track (Fastest Path to 5%)

**For every $X capital raised through their investor introductions, earn Y% equity:**

| Capital Raised | Earnout Earned | Cumulative Total | Rationale |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| **$500,000** | +0.5% | 2.0% (1.5% base + 0.5%) | 10x value: $500K ÷ $60K = 8.3x |
| **$1,000,000** | +1.0% | 3.0% (1.5% base + 1.5%) | 10x value: $1M ÷ $180K = 5.6x |
| **$2,000,000** | +1.5% | 4.5% (1.5% base + 3.0%) | 10x value: $2M ÷ $360K = 5.6x |
| **$3,000,000** | +0.5% | **5.0%** | Achieves full 5% target |

**Measurement:**
- "Raised through their introductions" = They made warm intro to investor who subsequently committed capital
- Must be documented with clear attribution
- Capital must be committed (signed SAFE/term sheet), not just "interested"
- Counts toward BH studio fundraising OR portfolio company fundraising

**Example:**
> Jocelyn introduces BH to her former colleague who's now a VC partner. After 3 meetings, the VC commits $750,000 to BH at $12M cap. Jocelyn earns 1.0% earnout equity. Her total equity: 2.5% (1.0% base + 1.5% earnout).

**Why This Works:**
- Capital is BH's #1 constraint
- $500K-$3M in capital is transformational for the studio
- 10x+ value ratio justifies the equity cost
- Directly solves BH's highest-priority need

---

### Pathway 2: Deal Sourcing Track

**For every qualified deal sourced that becomes a BH engagement:**

| Achievement | Earnout Earned | Cumulative Example | Value Created |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **2 deals signed** | +0.5% | 2.0% total | 2 × $200K engagements = $400K revenue |
| **4 deals signed** | +1.0% | 3.0% total | 4 × $200K = $800K revenue |
| **6 deals signed** | +1.5% | 4.5% total | 6 × $200K = $1.2M revenue |
| **8 deals signed** | +0.5% | **5.0%** total | 8 × $200K = $1.6M revenue |

**Qualification Criteria:**
- Deal must be introduced by J&D (clear attribution)
- BH signs engagement agreement (Foundation, Build, Launch, or Grow tier)
- Engagement generates minimum $100K in BH revenue
- Cannot claim deals already in BH pipeline pre-relationship

**Example:**
> Donovan connects BH with a media company executive exploring AI transformation. BH engages for Foundation tier ($150K) followed by Build tier ($500K). That's 2 deals signed = 0.5% earnout for Donovan. Plus the $650K revenue far exceeds the $60K equity cost.

**Why This Works:**
- Deal flow is BH's #2 constraint
- Each deal generates 3-10x revenue vs. equity cost
- Directly expands BH's venture pipeline
- Demonstrates ability to identify and convert opportunities

---

### Pathway 3: Revenue Generation Track

**For every $X revenue generated through their customer/partner introductions:**

| Revenue Generated | Earnout Earned | Cumulative Example |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **$500,000** | +0.5% | 2.0% total |
| **$1,000,000** | +1.0% | 3.0% total |
| **$2,000,000** | +1.5% | 4.5% total |
| **$3,000,000** | +0.5% | **5.0%** total |

**Attribution Rules:**
- Customer introduced by J&D who purchases BH services OR BH venture products
- Revenue must be recognized (not just pipeline)
- Attribution tracked for 24 months from introduction
- Counts across all BH ventures and services

**Example:**
> Jocelyn introduces WonderCast to a Singapore family education organization. They become a $250K/year customer, purchasing subscriptions for 5,000 families. Over 2 years, that's $500K revenue attributable to Jocelyn's intro = 0.5% earnout.

**Why This Works:**
- Revenue directly funds BH operations and growth
- $500K-$3M revenue is 10x+ the equity cost
- Demonstrates ability to drive commercial outcomes
- Solves Distribution/GTM constraint

---

### Pathway 4: Strategic Partnership Track

**For major strategic partnerships that create sustained value:**

| Partnership Type | Earnout Earned | Example |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Fremantle Distribution Deal** | +1.5% | Fremantle agrees to distribute WonderCast globally through their platforms |
| **Enterprise Partnership** | +1.0% | Major corporate (Google, Meta, etc.) partnership for BH venture |
| **Platform Partnership** | +1.0% | Netflix/Amazon featured placement for BH content/ventures |
| **Media Rights Deal** | +0.5% | Licensing or co-production deal worth $500K+ |

**Qualification:**
- Partnership must be facilitated/enabled by J&D introduction
- Documented economic value (revenue, distribution reach, cost savings)
- Exclusive or preferred terms that BH couldn't achieve independently
- Sustained relationship (not one-off)

**Example:**
> Jocelyn leverages BHP's Fremantle relationship to negotiate global distribution for WonderCast through Fremantle's platform network. This creates $2M+ in distribution value and market access BH couldn't get alone. Jocelyn earns 1.5% earnout.

**Why This Works:**
- Strategic partnerships create leverage (1+1=10 value creation)
- Hard to quantify but often most valuable long-term
- Demonstrates unique ability to activate high-value relationships
- Solves multiple constraints simultaneously

---

## Combined Earnout: Stack Multiple Pathways

**J&D can earn from multiple pathways simultaneously to reach 5%:**

### Example Scenario: Path to Full 5%

**Year 1:**
- Base equity vests (first 2 tranches): 0.75% (0.5% J + 0.25% D)
- Jocelyn introduces 2 investor contacts who commit $750K total: +1.0% earnout
- Donovan sources 1 media venture deal ($200K engagement): +0.25% earnout
- **End Year 1 Total: 2.0%**

**Year 2:**
- Base equity vests (final 2 tranches): +0.75% (0.5% J + 0.25% D)
- Jocelyn's investor relationships lead to additional $1M raised: +1.0% earnout
- Donovan facilitates Fremantle distribution partnership: +1.0% earnout
- Customer intro from Jocelyn generates $300K revenue: +0.5% earnout (partial)
- **End Year 2 Total: 5.25%** (cap at 5.0%)

**Result:** They achieve their 5% target by delivering:
- $1.75M capital raised
- 1 major deal sourced
- 1 transformational strategic partnership
- $300K+ revenue

**BH Gets:**
- $1.75M in funding (enables 2-3 more ventures)
- $500K revenue (funds operations)
- Fremantle distribution (worth $1M+ in market access)
- **Total value: $3M+** for 5% equity cost of $600K = **5x ROI**

---

## Earnout Vesting Mechanics

### How Earnout Tranches Vest

**Trigger-Based (Not Time-Based):**
- Earnout equity vests when milestone is achieved, regardless of timeline
- Faster achievement = faster vesting
- No vesting until milestone is met

**Example:**
> Month 8: Jocelyn introduces investor who commits $500,000
> Result: +0.5% earnout vests immediately
> Her total equity: 1.5% (1.0% base, of which 0.5% vested + 0.5% earnout)

### Cliff Protection

**12-Month Cliff on Base Equity:**
- Base 1.5% requires 12-month engagement minimum
- If relationship terminates <12 months, forfeit unvested base
- Protects BH from advisor churn

**No Cliff on Earnout:**
- Earnout vests immediately upon milestone achievement
- If they deliver $500K capital in month 6, they earn it
- Incentivizes fast execution

---

## Maximum Caps & Acceleration

### Cap at 5% Total Personal Equity

**Hard Cap:**
```
Max Personal Equity = 5.0%
Base = 1.5%
Max Earnout = 3.5%
Total = 5.0%
```

**What Happens if They Over-Deliver?**
- If they achieve milestones worth >3.5% earnout, cap at 5% total
- Additional value converts to:
  - Option A: Cash bonus (1% of value delivered beyond cap)
  - Option B: Venture-specific equity (doesn't count against studio cap)
  - Option C: Carried interest in future BH fund structure

---

### Acceleration Triggers

**Super Performance = Accelerated Vesting:**

| Achievement | Acceleration Effect |
|-------------|-------------------|
| $2M+ capital raised in <12 months | Immediate vest of 50% remaining base equity |
| 5+ deals sourced in <18 months | Immediate vest of 75% remaining base equity |
| $5M+ total value delivered in <24 months | Full 5% vests immediately (base + all earnout) |
| Major exit event (BH venture exits >$20M) | Full 5% vests + potential bonus pool participation |

**Example:**
> Month 10: Jocelyn has already introduced investors who committed $2.5M. This triggers:
> - Immediate vest of remaining base equity (50% of unvested base)
> - Earnout equity for capital milestones: +1.5%
> - Total vested equity at Month 10: 3.5%+ (vs. normal 0.75% at Month 10)

---

## Milestone Tracking & Verification

### Attribution Documentation

**For Capital Raised:**
- J&D makes warm introduction (email/meeting documented)
- Investor commits capital within 12 months of introduction
- Attribution recorded in investor documentation
- J&D cannot claim investors BH already knew/contacted

**For Deals Sourced:**
- J&D introduces opportunity (email/meeting documented)
- BH signs engagement agreement within 6 months
- Revenue generated and recognized
- J&D cannot claim deals already in BH pipeline

**For Revenue:**
- Customer introduced by J&D (documented)
- Revenue recognized (cash received)
- Attribution tracked for 24 months from introduction
- Partial credit if customer came through multiple channels (pro-rata)

**For Strategic Partnerships:**
- Partnership facilitated by J&D introduction/leverage
- Documented economic value (agreement terms, revenue, cost savings)
- BH confirms couldn't achieve independently
- Must be signed agreement, not just discussions

---

### Quarterly Tracking & Reporting

**Process:**
1. J&D report introductions made (names, context, expected value)
2. BH tracks conversion (capital committed, deals signed, revenue)
3. Quarterly review: Attribution confirmed, earnout calculation
4. Board approval: Earnout equity issued when milestones met

**Transparency:**
- J&D receive quarterly scorecard showing progress toward 5%
- Clear visibility into remaining milestones needed
- No surprises - everyone knows where they stand

---

## Decision Matrix: When BH Awards Earnout

### Automatic Earnout (Formula-Driven)

**These trigger automatic earnout calculation:**
- Capital raised: Formula = `Earnout_% = Capital_Raised / $1M`
- Deals sourced: Formula = `Earnout_% = Deals_Signed × 0.25%`
- Revenue: Formula = `Earnout_% = Revenue_Generated / $1M`

**No discretion - math drives it**

---

### Discretionary Earnout (Strategic Partnerships)

**Requires board approval:**
- Assess economic value (revenue, cost savings, strategic value)
- Confirm J&D's role was essential (couldn't achieve without them)
- Evaluate impact on BH (transformational vs. incremental)
- Assign earnout value (0.5% - 1.5% depending on impact)

**Criteria for Discretionary Approval:**
- Value > $500,000 (measured or reasonably projected)
- Unique to J&D relationship (BH couldn't achieve alone)
- Sustained impact (not one-time benefit)
- Documented with agreement/partnership terms

---

## Comparison: 5% Given vs. 5% Earned

### If BH Just Gives 5% Upfront

**Total Dilution:** 5.83% (5% personal + 0.83% BHP corporate)
**Growth Pool Consumed:** 39%
**Remaining Capacity:** 9.17%
**Value Required:** None (equity gifted on promise)
**Risk:** High - they might not deliver, BH can't take it back
**Outcome:** Constrained ability to bring in tech/capital partners

---

### If J&D Earn 5% Through Performance

**Base Dilution:** 2.33% (1.5% personal + 0.83% BHP corporate)
**Maximum Dilution:** 5.83% (if they earn full 5%)
**Value Delivered to Earn 5%:** $3M+ (capital + revenue + partnerships)
**Risk:** Low - only pay for results
**Outcome:**
- If they deliver → BH gets $3M+ value for $600K equity = 5x ROI
- If they don't deliver → BH only diluted 2.33%, preserved capacity for other partners

**Result:** BH wins either way
- Win big if they earn 5% (because value delivered >> equity cost)
- Win small if they don't (preserved equity for higher-ROI partners)

## Presentation to Jocelyn & Donovan

### The Pitch

> "We understand you're targeting 5% personal equity, and we want to create a path for you to achieve that. Here's our thinking:
>
> **The Challenge:** If we allocate 5% upfront, that's 39% of our Growth Pool and limits our ability to bring in the tech advisors and capital partners we need to succeed. We have to be strategic about equity allocation.
>
> **The Opportunity:** We're proposing a performance-based structure where you CAN earn your full 5%, but by delivering value that makes Being Human massively successful.
>
> **How It Works:**
> - **Base:** 1.5% combined for being excellent advisors (standard engagement)
> - **Earnout:** Up to 3.5% additional for exceptional performance
> - **Total Potential:** 5.0% if you deliver transformational results
>
> **Multiple Paths to 5%:**
> 1. Raise $3M in capital through investor intros → Earn full 5%
> 2. Source 8+ qualified deals that become BH engagements → Earn full 5%
> 3. Generate $3M in revenue through customer intros → Earn full 5%
> 4. Facilitate major strategic partnerships (Fremantle distribution, etc.) → Earn toward 5%
> 5. Combination of the above → Earn toward 5%
>
> **Why This is Better for You:**
> - You control your destiny (performance drives equity, not politics)
> - Upside is unlimited (if you over-deliver, we can structure bonuses beyond 5%)
> - Fast vesting (earn as you deliver, not time-based)
> - Aligned incentives (we only succeed if you succeed)
>
> **Why This Works for BH:**
> - We only pay for results (low risk)
> - Every earnout dollar creates 10x+ value for BH (high ROI)
> - Preserves equity budget for other critical partners if you don't deliver
> - Perfectly aligned incentives (we both win when milestones hit)
>
> **The Bottom Line:** If you can deliver the value you believe you can, you'll earn your 5%. And if you do, we'll be thrilled to give it to you because Being Human will be in a dramatically better position."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: "What if we deliver 3.5% worth of value but it takes 3 years?"

**A:** Earnout has no time limit. Achieve the milestones whenever, earn the equity. Some milestones (capital raised) may vest in months. Others (strategic partnerships) may take longer. We're measuring outcomes, not speed.

### Q: "What if we introduce 10 investors but none commit?"

**A:** Earnout is based on results (capital committed), not effort (introductions made). This ensures equity is awarded for value delivered, not activity. However, we'll track all intros - if none convert, we'll analyze why and adjust strategy together.

### Q: "Can we negotiate the earnout formulas?"

**A:** Absolutely. The formulas ($500K = 0.5%, etc.) are starting points. If you have data showing you can deliver more value, we can adjust. The principle remains: equity cost should be ~10% of value delivered.

### Q: "What if we deliver value but BH doesn't execute?"

**A:** Fair concern. Earnout milestones are based on your actions (intros made, deals sourced), not BH's execution. Example: If you introduce an investor who commits capital, you earn equity when they commit (not when BH deploys it successfully).

### Q: "What if we want to focus on one pathway (capital) vs. spreading across all?"

**A:** That's fine! The pathways are additive, not required. If you can raise $3M, you get to 5% through capital alone. If you prefer deal sourcing + partnerships, that works too. Pick your strengths.

### Q: "What happens if we leave before earning full 5%?"

**A:**
- Base equity: Standard vesting (12-month cliff, then quarterly)
- Earnout equity: Keeps what you earned (if you raised $1M before leaving, that 1% earnout is yours)
- Future earnout: Only milestones achieved while actively advising count

---

## Implementation Timeline

### Month 1-3: Foundation

- Execute agreements (base 1.5% + earnout structure)
- J&D map network and opportunities
- First quarterly review: Pipeline of potential intros

### Month 4-12: First Earnout Milestones

- Target: At least 1 earnout milestone achieved
- Examples: First investor intro that converts, first deal sourced, strategic partnership discussions
- Quarterly tracking of attribution and progress

### Month 13-24: Acceleration Phase

- Target: 3.0-4.0% total equity (base + earnouts)
- Momentum builds as early intros compound
- Strategic partnerships mature and close

### Month 25+: Sustaining Performance

- Target: Approaching or achieving 5% cap
- Focus shifts to maintaining relationships and identifying new opportunities
- Potential discussion of post-5% structures (bonuses, venture equity, etc.)

---

## Conclusion: The 5% is Available, But Must Be Earned

**Key Principles:**

1. **You CAN achieve 5%** - The path is clear and achievable
2. **But only through performance** - Not gifted, earned
3. **Multiple pathways** - Pick your strengths (capital, deals, revenue, partnerships)
4. **10x value ratio** - Every equity dollar requires $10+ value delivered
5. **Perfectly aligned** - We both win when milestones are hit

**Expected Outcome:**

- **If J&D are excellent advisors:** They earn 2-3% (base + some earnouts) = Fair compensation
- **If J&D are transformational:** They earn 4-5% (base + most earnouts) = BH dramatically better off
- **If J&D don't deliver:** They earn <2% (partial base) = BH preserves equity for better-ROI partners

**Result:** BH wins in all scenarios. The structure de-risks the 5% allocation while creating clear incentives for exceptional performance.
