# Beach House Pictures - Updated Deal Structure v2
## Net Offset Service Exchange Model (CORRECTED)

**Date:** February 1, 2026
**Status:** Corrected Structure with Dynamic Formulas

---

## Executive Summary

Beach House Pictures partnership structured as **net offset service exchange**:
- BHP provides storytelling services (value: `$X`)
- BH provides AI consultation services (value: `$Y`)
- Net difference (`$X - $Y`) converts to BH studio equity
- No cash changes hands

**Example with placeholder values:**
- BHP Services: $150,000
- BH Services: $50,000
- **Net: $100,000 converts to 0.83% BH equity** (at $12M cap)

---

## Deal Structure

### Part 1: Corporate Service Exchange

| Party | Services Provided | Cash Value Equivalent |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Beach House Pictures** | Storyteller in Residence | `BHP_Service_Value` |
| **Being Human** | Generative AI Playground Consultation | `BH_Service_Value` |
| **Net Differential** | BHP provides more value | `Net_Diff = BHP_Service_Value - BH_Service_Value` |

**Equity Conversion Formula:**
```
BHP_Corporate_Equity_% = (Net_Diff / BH_Valuation_Cap) × 100
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Net_Diff = $150,000 - $50,000 = $100,000
BH_Valuation_Cap = $12,000,000
BHP_Corporate_Equity_% = ($100,000 / $12,000,000) × 100 = 0.83%
```

---

### Part 2: Personal Advisory Equity (Separate from Corporate)

**Jocelyn & Donovan Request:** 5% combined personal advisory equity

**BH Analysis:**
- This is **separate** from the corporate service exchange (0.83%)
- Total dilution would be: `Corporate_% + Personal_%`
- Example: 0.83% + 5.0% = **5.83% total studio dilution**

**BH Counter-Offer:**
- Jocelyn Personal: `Jocelyn_%` (recommend 0.75%)
- Donovan Personal: `Donovan_%` studio + venture-specific (recommend 0.5% studio)
- Total Personal: `Jocelyn_% + Donovan_%` (recommend 1.25%)

**Total Dilution Formula:**
```
Total_Studio_Dilution_% = BHP_Corporate_% + Jocelyn_% + Donovan_%
```

**Example:**
```
BHP_Corporate = 0.83%
Jocelyn = 0.75%
Donovan = 0.5%
Total = 2.08%
```

## Cap Table Impact Analysis

### Scenario A: Recommended Structure (2.08% Total)

**Inputs:**
- BHP Services: $150,000
- BH Services: $50,000
- BH Valuation: $12,000,000
- Jocelyn Personal: 0.75%
- Donovan Personal: 0.5%

**Calculations:**
```
Corporate = ($150K - $50K) / $12M = 0.83%
Personal = 0.75% + 0.5% = 1.25%
Total Dilution = 0.83% + 1.25% = 2.08%
Growth Pool Remaining = 15% - 2.08% - 0.5% (Gay) = 12.42%
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Low Growth Pool consumption (14%)
- ✅ 12.42% remaining for tech advisors, capital partners, etc.
- ✅ Can build complete partner portfolio

---

### Scenario B: Accept Full Request (5.83% Total)

- BH Services: $50,000
- BH Valuation: $12,000,000
- Jocelyn Personal: 2.5%
- Donovan Personal: 2.5%

**Calculations:**
```
Corporate = ($150K - $50K) / $12M = 0.83%
Personal = 2.5% + 2.5% = 5.0%
Total Dilution = 0.83% + 5.0% = 5.83%
Growth Pool Remaining = 15% - 5.83% - 0.5% (Gay) = 8.67%
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ High Growth Pool consumption (39%)
- ❌ Only 8.67% remaining for all other partners
- ❌ Cannot afford tech advisors AND capital partners AND domain experts
