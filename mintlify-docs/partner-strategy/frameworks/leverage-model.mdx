# BH Partner Leverage Model
## Internal Strategic Framework | v1.0 | February 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document defines Being Human's macro model for partner engagement. Every partner relationship should solve for one or more of our **three core constraints**: Capital Access, Deal Flow, and Distribution/GTM.

**Core Principle:** Equity is earned through measurable outcomes, not promised for potential. All partner equity is performance-gated with specific milestone triggers.

---

## THE LEVERAGE EQUATION

```
Partner Value = (Constraint Solved) × (Velocity of Impact) × (Repeatability)
```

**Constraint Solved:** Does this partner directly address Capital, Deal Flow, or Distribution?
**Velocity of Impact:** How quickly can they deliver measurable results?
**Repeatability:** Is this a one-time contribution or ongoing leverage?

Partners who score high on all three dimensions warrant higher equity allocations and faster vesting schedules.

## WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH BY PARTNER TYPE

### 1. Strategic Advisors

**Primary Constraint Solved:** Deal Flow + Capital Access

**Strategic Intent:**
- Source qualified venture opportunities that fit BH thesis
- Open doors to investors, LPs, and strategic capital
- Provide credibility that accelerates conversations

**What Success Looks Like:**
- Introductions that convert to signed engagements or investments
- Warm paths to capital we couldn't access directly
- Validation that shortens sales cycles

**Why This Matters:**
Advisors are leverage on relationships. A well-connected advisor can compress months of relationship-building into a single introduction. But introductions without conversion are worthless - hence performance-gating.

---

### 2. Deal & Capital Partners

**Primary Constraint Solved:** Capital Access + Deal Flow

**Strategic Intent:**
- Commit capital to BH studio or specific ventures
- Source and originate deals that become BH ventures
- Act as force multipliers for fundraising efforts

**What Success Looks Like:**
- Capital committed and deployed
- Deals originated that close as BH engagements
- LP/investor introductions that convert

**Why This Matters:**
Capital partners should bring both money and deal flow. Pure capital without strategic value gets standard SAFE terms. Partners who also originate deals or bring other investors warrant additional equity from the Growth Pool.

---

### 3. Domain Experts

**Primary Constraint Solved:** Deal Flow (validation) + Distribution (customer access)

**Strategic Intent:**
- Validate product direction before we build
- Connect us to customers who will buy what we build
- Provide domain credibility that opens markets

**What Success Looks Like:**
- Product validation that prevents wasted build cycles
- Customer introductions that convert to revenue
- Domain insights that shape winning products

**Why This Matters:**
Domain experts de-risk ventures. Their validation is a form of deal flow (confirming we should pursue an opportunity). Their customer connections are distribution. Without both, they're just consultants.

---

### 4. Venture Operators

**Primary Constraint Solved:** Execution Capacity (enables all three constraints)

**Strategic Intent:**
- Run portfolio companies so BH can scale horizontally
- Build teams and systems that create enterprise value
- Execute on the strategy we help define

**What Success Looks Like:**
- Product shipped on timeline
- Revenue targets hit
- Team scaled effectively
- Funding rounds closed

**Why This Matters:**
Operators are the constraint that emerges once we solve Capital and Deal Flow. Without operators, BH becomes a bottleneck. Great operators allow BH to take on more ventures.

---

### 5. GTM & Distribution Partners

**Primary Constraint Solved:** Distribution/GTM (primary)

**Strategic Intent:**
- Provide channels to customers we can't reach directly
- Compress customer acquisition timelines
- Create sustainable distribution moats

**What Success Looks Like:**
- Revenue generated through their channels
- Customers acquired at lower CAC than direct
- Market access that would take years to build organically

**Why This Matters:**
Distribution is often the hardest constraint. A partner with existing customer relationships can collapse years of market development into months. These partnerships warrant significant equity when they deliver.

---

### 6. Brand & Storytelling Partners

**Primary Constraint Solved:** Distribution (awareness) + Deal Flow (positioning)

**Strategic Intent:**
- Create compelling narratives that open markets
- Build brand equity that compounds over time
- Differentiate BH ventures in crowded markets

**What Success Looks Like:**
- Marketing assets that convert
- Brand awareness that shortens sales cycles
- Positioning that commands premium pricing

**Why This Matters:**
Brand is leverage on attention. Strong brands reduce CAC, increase conversion, and create pricing power. But brand work without measurable impact is just creative services.

## PERFORMANCE-GATED VESTING MODEL

### Principle: No Milestone = No Equity

Traditional vesting rewards time served. Performance-gated vesting rewards outcomes delivered. Each partner type has specific milestones that unlock equity tranches.

### Milestone Categories

| Category | Definition | Measurement |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Capital Milestone** | Investor introduction that converts to committed capital | $ committed, not just introduced |
| **Deal Milestone** | Opportunity sourced that becomes signed BH engagement | Signed engagement, not just introduction |
| **Revenue Milestone** | Customer/channel that generates attributable revenue | $ revenue, tracked by source |
| **Product Milestone** | Deliverable shipped that meets acceptance criteria | Ship date + quality bar |
| **Network Milestone** | Introduction that opens strategic relationship | Relationship established, not just meeting |

---

## VESTING MILESTONES BY PARTNER TYPE

### Strategic Advisors (0.25% - 2.0% studio equity)

| Tranche | % of Total | Milestone Trigger |
|---------|------------|-------------------|

| Tranche 3 (25%) | Month 15 | Cumulative 3 conversions |
| Tranche 4 (25%) | Month 24 | Cumulative 5 conversions OR $500K+ attributed capital |

**Acceleration Trigger:** $1M+ capital raised through introductions = immediate full vest

---

## PARTNER EVALUATION SCORING MODEL

### Overview

Every potential partner is scored on a 0-100 scale across five dimensions. Minimum threshold for engagement: **60 points**. Recommended threshold for equity participation: **75 points**.

### Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | What We're Measuring |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Constraint Fit** | 30% | How directly do they solve Capital, Deal Flow, or Distribution? |
| **Track Record** | 25% | Evidence of past success in similar partnerships |
| **Network Quality** | 20% | Relevance and depth of their relationships to BH needs |
| **Alignment** | 15% | Cultural fit, long-term orientation, values match |
| **Availability** | 10% | Actual capacity to contribute given other commitments |

### Scoring Guide

**Constraint Fit (0-30 points)**
- 25-30: Directly solves primary constraint with proven mechanism
- 18-24: Solves constraint but mechanism less proven or indirect
- 10-17: Partial constraint fit, secondary benefit
- 0-9: Doesn't clearly solve any core constraint

**Track Record (0-25 points)**
- 20-25: Documented success in similar partnerships, measurable outcomes
- 14-19: Some relevant experience, mixed or unclear results
- 7-13: Limited relevant track record
- 0-6: No relevant experience or negative references

**Network Quality (0-20 points)**
- 16-20: Deep, relevant relationships with direct access
- 11-15: Good network with some relevance gaps
- 6-10: Network exists but relevance unclear
- 0-5: Limited or irrelevant network

**Alignment (0-15 points)**
- 12-15: Strong cultural fit, long-term oriented, values aligned
- 8-11: Generally aligned with some potential friction points
- 4-7: Alignment concerns but manageable
- 0-3: Significant alignment risks

**Availability (0-10 points)**
- 8-10: Clear capacity, prioritizes BH engagement
- 5-7: Available but has competing commitments
- 2-4: Limited availability, concerns about follow-through
- 0-1: Overcommitted, unlikely to deliver

### Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 85-100 | **Pursue Aggressively** - Prioritize, offer favorable terms |
| 75-84 | **Strong Candidate** - Standard terms, active pursuit |
| 60-74 | **Qualified** - Proceed with caution, validate concerns |
| 40-59 | **Watchlist** - Don't pursue now, revisit if circumstances change |
| 0-39 | **Pass** - Does not meet threshold for BH partnership |
