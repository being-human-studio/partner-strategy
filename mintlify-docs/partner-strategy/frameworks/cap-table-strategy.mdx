# Being Human Cap Table Strategy Framework
## Strategic Partner & Advisor Allocation Model

**Date:** February 1, 2026
**Purpose:** Define optimal partner/advisor equity allocation to achieve BH's strategic objectives without excessive dilution

---

## Executive Summary

Being Human needs to strategically allocate studio equity to partners and advisors who solve core constraints (Capital Access, Deal Flow, Distribution/GTM). This framework defines:

1. **Total equity budget** for partners/advisors
2. **Critical needs** by partner type
3. **Optimal number** of each partner type
4. **Allocation ranges** per partner
5. **Evaluation criteria** to rank opportunities

**Key Principle:** Every percentage point of equity must solve a specific, measurable constraint. No equity for "nice to have" relationships.

## Part 1: Cap Table Architecture

### Being Human Equity Structure

| Stakeholder Category | Allocation | Purpose |
|---------------------|------------|---------|
| **Founders & Team** | 60-70% | Kyle, Steve, Ram, Jaden, future hires |
| **Growth Pool** | 15-20% | Strategic advisors and partners (studio-level) |
| **Investors** | 10-15% | Capital partners (SAFEs, priced rounds) |
| **Employee Options** | 5-10% | Future team incentives |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | |

**Growth Pool Deep Dive (15-20% Total):**

| Partner Type | Allocation from Growth Pool | # of Partners | Avg per Partner |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Strategic Advisors** | 4-6% | 4-6 advisors | 0.75-1.0% each |
| **Deal & Capital Partners** | 3-5% | 3-5 partners | 0.75-1.25% each |
| **Domain Experts** | 2-3% | 2-3 experts | 0.75-1.0% each |
| **GTM & Distribution** | 3-4% | 2-3 partners | 1.0-1.5% each |
| **Brand & Storytelling** | 1-2% | 1-2 partners | 0.5-1.0% each |
| **Operational Partners** | 2-3% | Variable | Venture-specific |
| **TOTAL GROWTH POOL** | **15-20%** | **15-20 partners** | |

**Reserve:** Keep 2-3% unallocated for opportunistic partnerships

---

## Part 2: Critical Needs by Partner Type

### Strategic Advisors (4-6% total allocation / 4-6 partners)

**What They Solve:** Deal flow + Capital access + Network validation

**Critical Capabilities:**
1. **Senior Executive Experience** - Board-level, C-suite, built/scaled companies
2. **Relevant Networks** - Direct access to investors, LPs, strategic partners
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Can guide on pitfalls and opportunities
4. **Credibility** - Name recognition that opens doors

**Optimal Portfolio:**
- 1-2 **Tech/AI advisors** (startup ecosystem, AI investors, tech talent)
- 1-2 **Industry advisors** (domain expertise in BH's focus areas)
- 1-2 **Capital/investor advisors** (LP networks, fundraising guidance)

**How Many Needed:** 4-6 maximum (more creates coordination overhead)

**Allocation per Advisor:** 0.75-1.0% for Tier 1, 0.5-0.75% for Tier 2

**Current State:** 0 formalized strategic advisors

**Gap:** Need 4-6 advisors, budget 4-6% equity

---

### Deal & Capital Partners (3-5% total / 3-5 partners)

**What They Solve:** Capital access (primary) + Deal flow (secondary)

**Critical Capabilities:**
1. **Capital Commitment** - Investing $100K+ in BH
2. **LP/Investor Networks** - Can introduce other investors
3. **Deal Origination** - Source venture opportunities that fit BH thesis
4. **Strategic Value** - Beyond just money (industry expertise, connections)

**Optimal Portfolio:**
- 1-2 **Anchor investors** ($250K+ checks, strong networks)
- 2-3 **Strategic investors** ($100-250K checks, domain expertise + capital)

**How Many Needed:** 3-5 (enough to diversify investor base, not so many that cap table is messy)

**Allocation per Partner:** 0.5-1.5% (based on investment size + strategic value)

**Current State:** Gay Chee Cheong (preliminary Luminary commitment, not formalized)

**Gap:** Need 2-4 more capital partners, budget 3-5% equity

---

### Domain Experts (2-3% total / 2-3 experts)

**What They Solve:** Deal flow validation + Distribution (customer access)

**Critical Capabilities:**
1. **Deep Vertical Expertise** - 10+ years in specific industry
2. **Customer Relationships** - Can introduce paying customers
3. **Product Validation** - Prevents wasted build cycles
4. **Domain Credibility** - Market trusts their endorsement

**Optimal Portfolio:**
- 1 **Education/Family** expert (Luminary, WonderCast domain)
- 1 **Enterprise/B2B** expert (Kavlo, future B2B ventures domain)
- 1 **Media/Entertainment** expert (content ventures, distribution)

**How Many Needed:** 2-3 (one per major domain BH operates in)

**Allocation per Expert:** 0.75-1.0% for advisor track, 5-15% for co-founder track (venture-specific)

**Current State:** Beach House Pictures could fill media/entertainment domain expert role

**Gap:** Need education/family expert, enterprise expert

---

### GTM & Distribution Partners (3-4% total / 2-3 partners)

**What They Solve:** Distribution/GTM (primary constraint)

**Critical Capabilities:**
1. **Channel Ownership** - Direct access to customers BH can't reach
2. **Distribution Scale** - Can move needle on customer acquisition
3. **Credibility** - Name/brand that accelerates sales cycles
4. **Sustainability** - Long-term channel, not one-time deal

**Optimal Portfolio:**
- 1 **Platform/Marketplace** partner (distribution for BH ventures)
- 1 **Enterprise** partner (B2B distribution channels)
- 1 **Media/Content** partner (content distribution, brand amplification)

**How Many Needed:** 2-3 (high-leverage distribution channels)

**Allocation per Partner:** 1.0-1.5% for significant channels, or revenue share instead of equity

**Current State:** Beach House Pictures (media/content distribution via Fremantle)

**Gap:** Need platform and enterprise distribution partners

---

### Brand & Storytelling Partners (1-2% total / 1-2 partners)

**What They Solve:** Distribution (awareness) + Deal flow (positioning)

**Critical Capabilities:**
1. **World-Class Creative** - Emmy/award-level quality
2. **Brand Building** - Not just marketing execution
3. **Measurable Impact** - Can demonstrate lift in conversion, awareness
4. **Scalability** - Can work across portfolio, not just one venture

**Optimal Portfolio:**
- 1 **Production/Content** partner (BHP fills this role)
- 1 **Brand Strategy** partner (positioning, messaging, visual identity)

**How Many Needed:** 1-2 (more creates brand inconsistency)

**Allocation per Partner:** 0.5-1.0% for studio level, 1-3% venture-specific

**Current State:** Beach House Pictures (production partner)

**Gap:** Potentially need brand strategist (separate from production)

---

### Operational Partners (2-3% total / Variable)

**What They Solve:** Execution capacity (enables all constraints)

**Critical Capabilities:**
1. **Venture Operating Experience** - GM/CEO of startups
2. **Team Building** - Can recruit and scale teams
3. **Execution Excellence** - Ships on time, hits milestones
4. **Self-Sufficient** - Reduces BH's operational burden

**Optimal Portfolio:**
- Venture-specific (each portfolio company has operator)
- Not studio-level allocation (venture cap table)

**How Many Needed:** 1 per venture (3-5 total across portfolio)

**Allocation per Partner:** 5-15% venture equity (not studio equity)

**Current State:** Kyle + Steve operating WonderCast, need operators for Luminary, Kavlo

**Gap:** 2-3 venture operators needed (venture equity, not studio equity)

---

## Part 3: Optimal Partner Portfolio

### Target State (Studio Equity Allocation)

| Partner Type | # Needed | Total Equity | Status | Priority |
|--------------|----------|--------------|--------|----------|
| **Strategic Advisors** | 4-6 | 4-6% | 0% allocated | **HIGH** |
| **Deal & Capital** | 3-5 | 3-5% | ~0.5% (Gay Chee Cheong pending) | **HIGH** |
| **Domain Experts** | 2-3 | 2-3% | 0% allocated | **MEDIUM** |
| **GTM & Distribution** | 2-3 | 3-4% | ~2.5% (BHP proposed) | **MEDIUM** |
| **Brand & Storytelling** | 1-2 | 1-2% | ~2.5% (BHP proposed, overlaps GTM) | **LOW** |
| **TOTAL** | **15-20** | **15-20%** | **~5.5% allocated/proposed** | |

**Available Equity Budget:** 15-20% (Growth Pool)
**Currently Allocated/Proposed:** 5.5% (Gay Chee Cheong + BHP)
**Remaining Budget:** 9.5-14.5%

---

## Part 4: Evaluating Beach House 5% Request

### The Request

**Jocelyn & Donovan:** Combined 5% studio equity as personal advisors

### Analysis Against Cap Table Strategy

**Proposed Allocation:**
- Beach House Pictures (corporate): 2.5% for storytelling services
- Jocelyn & Donovan (personal): 5% combined advisory equity
- **Total BHP-related dilution: 7.5%**

**Issues with 5% Request:**

1. **Consumes 25-33% of Total Growth Pool**
   - Growth Pool = 15-20% total
   - Jocelyn & Donovan 5% = 25-33% of available equity
   - Limits ability to bring in other critical partners

2. **Significantly Above Strategic Advisor Range**
   - Strategic advisors typically get 0.75-1.0% each
   - 5% combined = 2.5% each (2.5-3.3x typical allocation)
   - Would be highest-paid advisors by far

3. **Network Overlap Creates Over-Payment**
   - Jocelyn & Donovan share 90%+ of networks (married co-founders)
   - Also overlaps with BHP corporate partnership (already getting 2.5%)
   - Paying 3 times for same relationships (BHP 2.5% + Jocelyn 2.5% + Donovan 2.5% = 7.5% total)

4. **Crowds Out Higher-Priority Needs**
   - Still need 4-6 strategic advisors (tech, capital, industry)
   - Still need 2-4 capital partners with investor networks
   - 5% to Jocelyn/Donovan leaves only 9.5-14.5% for everyone else

5. **Not Aligned with Constraint Priority**
   - BH's #1 constraint = Capital Access (investors, LPs)
   - BH's #2 constraint = Deal Flow (venture opportunities)
   - BH's #3 constraint = Distribution/GTM
   - Jocelyn/Donovan primarily solve #3 (Distribution via media)
   - Should prioritize equity to partners who solve #1 and #2 first

### Comparative Analysis

| Partner | Proposed Equity | Constraint Solved | Network Overlap | Priority vs. BH Needs |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Jocelyn & Donovan** | 5% combined | Distribution + Deal Flow (media) | 90% overlap with each other + BHP corporate | Medium (solve #3 constraint) |
| **Hypothetical Tech Advisor** | 1% | Capital Access + Deal Flow (tech) | 0% overlap | **High** (solve #1 & #2) |
| **Hypothetical LP/Investor** | 1.25% | Capital Access (primary) | 0% overlap | **High** (solve #1) |
| **Hypothetical Enterprise Expert** | 0.75% | Distribution (B2B channels) | 0% overlap | **High** (solve #3, different channel) |

**Insight:** 5% to Jocelyn/Donovan consumes same equity as 5+ other advisors who would solve higher-priority constraints without overlap.

---

## Part 5: Counter-Proposal Framework

### Option 1: Lower Combined Allocation (Recommended)

**Structure:**
- **Jocelyn & Donovan Combined:** 1.5% studio equity (vs. 5% requested)
- **Rationale:** Reflects Strategic Advisor tier (2 advisors × 0.75% = 1.5%)
- **Plus:** Venture-specific equity for Donovan on WonderCast/Luminary (1-1.5% per venture)
- **Total Studio Dilution:** 1.5% (vs. 5% requested)
- **Total Dilution (including venture):** ~4% if both ventures grant Donovan equity

**Why This Works:**
- Recognizes their expertise and networks (1.5% is meaningful)
- Aligns Donovan with ventures where creative contribution is highest (venture equity)
- Preserves Growth Pool for other critical partners (tech, capital, enterprise)
- Avoids over-payment for overlapping networks

**Presentation to Jocelyn & Donovan:**
> "We value your expertise tremendously. However, we need to allocate studio equity strategically across multiple partners to solve our core constraints (capital, deal flow, distribution). We'd like to offer 1.5% combined studio equity plus significant venture-specific equity for Donovan on WonderCast and Luminary, where his creative vision is most impactful. This structure gives you meaningful upside while preserving our ability to bring in tech advisors, investor networks, and other critical partners."

---

### Option 2: Separate Corporate and Personal (Alternative)

**Structure:**
- **Beach House Pictures (corporate):** 2.5% for storytelling services
- **Jocelyn (personal):** 0.75% strategic advisor equity
- **Donovan (personal):** 0.5% strategic advisor equity + venture-specific equity
- **Total:** 3.75% studio equity + venture-specific

**Why This Works:**
- Clearly separates corporate services (BHP) from personal advisory (Jocelyn & Donovan)
- Personal advisory equity is within Strategic Advisor range
- Still meaningful total package when combined with BHP corporate equity

**Presentation:**
> "We're structuring two separate relationships: (1) Beach House Pictures corporate partnership for storytelling services (2.5% equity), and (2) your personal advisory roles (1.25% combined). This recognizes both the corporate value BHP brings and your individual expertise. Total package is 3.75% studio equity plus venture-specific equity for Donovan on media ventures."

---

### Option 3: Performance-Based with Upside (Aggressive)

**Structure:**
- **Base:** 2.5% combined studio equity
- **Earnout:** Up to 2.5% additional equity based on performance milestones
- **Total Potential:** 5% (matching their request) if they deliver exceptional results

**Performance Milestones for Earnout:**
- +0.5% for every $500K capital raised through their introductions (up to $2.5M)
- +0.5% for every 2 signed BH engagements sourced through their networks
- +0.5% for achieving 3x baseline brand awareness for BH ventures (measurable via media coverage, inbound leads)

**Why This Works:**
- Meets their 5% request but requires exceptional performance to achieve
- Aligns equity with outcomes (pay for results, not potential)
- If they truly deliver 5% value, they earn 5% equity

**Presentation:**
> "We'd like to structure a path to your requested 5% equity. We'll start with a base 2.5% and you can earn up to an additional 2.5% by hitting specific performance milestones around capital raised, deals sourced, and brand impact. This way, if you deliver the exceptional value you believe you can, you'll get the full 5%. It aligns our incentives perfectly."

## Part 6: Recommended Allocation Strategy

### Prioritized Partner Pipeline

**Phase 1 (Next 6 Months):**
| Priority | Partner Type | Allocation | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|------------|---------|
| 1 | **Tech/AI Strategic Advisor** | 1.0% | Capital access (AI investor networks), deal flow (tech ventures) |
| 2 | **Capital Partner (Anchor)** | 1.25% | $250K+ investment + LP introductions |
| 3 | **Beach House (Jocelyn & Donovan)** | 1.5% | Distribution (media), deal flow (media ventures) |
| **Total Phase 1** | | **3.75%** | |

**Phase 2 (Months 7-12):**
| Priority | Partner Type | Allocation | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|------------|---------|
| 4 | **Capital Partner #2** | 1.0% | $100-250K investment + strategic value |
| 5 | **Enterprise GTM Partner** | 1.25% | B2B distribution channels (for Kavlo, future enterprise ventures) |
| 6 | **Industry Strategic Advisor** | 0.75% | Domain expertise in BH focus area (education, media, or enterprise) |
| **Total Phase 2** | | **3.0%** | |

**Phase 3 (Months 13-24):**
| Priority | Partner Type | Allocation | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|------------|---------|
| 7 | **Capital Partner #3** | 0.75% | Additional investor diversity |
| 8 | **Strategic Advisor (Capital Focus)** | 0.75% | LP networks, fundraising strategy |
| 9 | **Domain Expert (Education)** | 0.75% | Luminary/WonderCast validation and customer access |
| **Total Phase 3** | | **2.25%** | |

**Total 24-Month Allocation: 9.0%** (within 15-20% Growth Pool budget)
**Remaining for Future:** 6-11% (for opportunistic partnerships, future needs)

### Why This Sequencing

1. **Lead with capital** - Solve #1 constraint first (investor networks, fundraising)
2. **Balance with strategic** - Tech advisor + Beach House provide complementary networks
3. **Build GTM foundation** - Media (BHP) + Enterprise (Phase 2) cover distribution needs
4. **Preserve flexibility** - Don't over-allocate early; keep 6-11% for future opportunities

---

## Part 7: Decision Framework for Each Opportunity

For every proposed partner/advisor, evaluate against this scorecard:

### Evaluation Scorecard (0-100 points)

| Dimension | Weight | Score Range | Key Questions |
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Constraint Fit** | 30% | 0-30 | Does this partner directly solve Capital, Deal Flow, or Distribution? Is mechanism proven? |
| **Track Record** | 25% | 0-25 | Do they have documented success in similar partnerships? Measurable outcomes? |
| **Network Quality** | 20% | 0-20 | Do they have deep, current relationships with people/orgs BH needs? Can they activate them? |
| **Uniqueness** | 15% | 0-15 | Do they bring networks/expertise we don't have? Or overlap with existing partners? |
| **Availability** | 10% | 0-10 | Do they have capacity to deliver? Or overcommitted? |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | 0-100 | |

**Scoring Thresholds:**
- **85-100:** Pursue aggressively, offer top of range
- **75-84:** Strong candidate, standard terms
- **60-74:** Qualified, proceed with caution
- **Below 60:** Pass or watchlist

### Allocation Decision Tree

```
1. Does partner score 60+?
   ├─ NO → PASS
   └─ YES → Continue to #2

2. What constraint do they primarily solve?
   ├─ Capital Access → Allocate from Capital Partner budget (3-5%)
   ├─ Deal Flow → Allocate from Strategic Advisor budget (4-6%)
   └─ Distribution → Allocate from GTM Partner budget (3-4%)

3. Do they overlap with existing partners?
   ├─ NO → Offer standard range for tier/score
   └─ YES → Reduce allocation by 25-50% OR defer until higher-priority needs filled

4. What's their uniqueness score?
   ├─ 12-15 (high uniqueness) → Offer top of range
   ├─ 8-11 (medium uniqueness) → Offer mid-range
   └─ 0-7 (low uniqueness) → Offer bottom of range OR pass

5. How many partners of this type do we already have?
   ├─ Below target → PURSUE
   ├─ At target → Only pursue if score 85+
   └─ Above target → DEFER unless exceptional (90+)
```

---

## Part 8: Beach House Decision (Applied Framework)

### Scoring Jocelyn & Donovan (Combined)

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Constraint Fit | 23/30 | Solve Distribution (media), partial Deal Flow; don't solve Capital (highest priority) |
| Track Record | 20/25 | Exceptional in media/production, unproven in venture studio advisory |
| Network Quality | 16/20 | Strong media networks, less relevant to tech/AI investors BH needs |
| Uniqueness | 8/15 | Media networks valuable, but overlap with BHP corporate + each other (married) |
| Availability | 7/10 | MD + Creative Director roles = significant commitments |
| **TOTAL** | **74/100** | **Tier 2 - Qualified** |

**Interpretation:** Score 74/100 = "Qualified, proceed with caution"
- Not in "Pursue Aggressively" range (85+)
- Within Strategic Advisor tier but not top tier
- Uniqueness score (8/15) suggests allocation should be mid-to-lower range

### Allocation Recommendation

**Using Decision Tree:**
1. ✅ Score 74 → Pass threshold (60+)
2. Primary constraint = Distribution → Allocate from GTM budget (3-4%)
3. ⚠️ Overlap with BHP corporate (90%+) → Reduce by 50%
4. Uniqueness = 8/15 (medium) → Offer mid-range
5. GTM Partners needed = 2-3, currently have 0 → Pursue, but not exclusively

**Recommended Allocation:**
- **1.5% combined studio equity** (mid-range for 2 Strategic Advisors)
- Rationale: 2 advisors × 0.75% = 1.5% (standard Strategic Advisor allocation)
- Reduction from typical 2 × 1.0% = 2.0% due to overlap with BHP corporate

**Alternative if they insist on 5%:**
- Counter with Option 3 (Performance-Based): 2.5% base + 2.5% earnout
- Or: Decline and prioritize higher-score opportunities (tech advisor, capital partners)

---

## Part 9: Cap Table Sensitivity Analysis

### Scenario A: Accept 5% Request

| Partner Type | Equity Allocated | Remaining Budget |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Beach House (Jocelyn & Donovan) | 5.0% | |
| BHP Corporate | 2.5% | |
| **Subtotal BHP-Related** | **7.5%** | |
| Remaining for all other partners | | **7.5-12.5%** |

**Impact:**
- ❌ Only 7.5-12.5% left for tech advisors, capital partners, enterprise distribution
- ❌ BHP consumes 37-50% of Growth Pool (for one relationship cluster)
- ❌ Forces choosing between tech advisor OR capital partners (can't afford both well)

### Scenario B: Counter at 1.5%

| Partner Type | Equity Allocated | Remaining Budget |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Beach House (Jocelyn & Donovan) | 1.5% | |
| BHP Corporate | 2.5% | |
| **Subtotal BHP-Related** | **4.0%** | |
| Remaining for all other partners | | **11-16%** |

**Impact:**
- ✅ 11-16% available for tech advisors (1-2), capital partners (2-3), enterprise distribution (1)
- ✅ BHP consumes 20-27% of Growth Pool (reasonable for important relationship)
- ✅ Can afford full partner portfolio as outlined in prioritized pipeline

### Scenario C: Decline Personal Advisory, Keep Corporate Only

| Partner Type | Equity Allocated | Remaining Budget |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Beach House (Jocelyn & Donovan) | 0% | |
| BHP Corporate | 2.5% | |
| **Subtotal BHP-Related** | **2.5%** | |
| Remaining for all other partners | | **12.5-17.5%** |

**Impact:**
- ✅ Maximum flexibility for other partners
- ✅ BHP corporate partnership still delivers media distribution value
- ⚠️ May damage relationship if they expect personal advisory equity
- ⚠️ Lose Jocelyn's business development networks (though overlap with corporate)

**Recommendation:** Scenario B (Counter at 1.5%) balances relationship preservation with cap table strategy

---

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways

1. **Growth Pool Budget = 15-20% total**
   - Need to allocate across 15-20 partners strategically
   - Can't give 5% to one partner cluster without sacrificing critical needs

2. **Priority Order:** Capital Access > Deal Flow > Distribution
   - Jocelyn & Donovan primarily solve Distribution (#3 priority)
   - Should prioritize equity to partners solving Capital and Deal Flow first

3. **Recommended Counter-Offer:** 1.5% combined studio equity
   - Aligns with Strategic Advisor range (0.75% × 2 advisors)
   - Plus venture-specific equity for Donovan (1-1.5% per media venture)
   - Preserves Growth Pool for higher-priority partners

4. **BHP Corporate Deal:** 2.5% equity for storytelling services
   - Separate from personal advisory
   - Total BHP-related dilution: 4% (2.5% corporate + 1.5% personal)
   - Within acceptable range given media distribution value

5. **Next Steps:**
   - Present cap table strategy to Jocelyn & Donovan
   - Frame 1.5% as "strategic allocation that allows us to build complete partner portfolio"
   - Emphasize venture-specific upside for Donovan (total package competitive)
   - Be prepared to walk away if they insist on 5% (prioritize tech and capital partners instead)
