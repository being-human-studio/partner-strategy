## Customization Guidelines

### When to Adjust Milestones

- Venture is further along (existing revenue/traction)
- Constraint need is urgent

**Lengthen timelines when:**
- Partner is unproven (score 60-74)
- Venture is early stage (pre-product)
- Market conditions uncertain

### When to Adjust Equity

**Increase allocation when:**
- Partner brings multiple constraint solutions
- Exceptional track record with measurable outcomes
- Taking meaningful risk (leaving role, exclusive commitment)
- Brings capital in addition to other value

**Decrease allocation when:**
- Partner is one of several in same category
- Testing relationship before larger commitment
- Partner has limited time availability
- Value proposition has uncertainty
