## Constraint Fit (30 points)

**What we're measuring:** How directly does this partner solve BH's core constraints (Capital, Deal Flow, Distribution)?

### Scoring Criteria

**25-30 points: Direct, Proven Mechanism**
- Clear track record of delivering on this constraint
- Specific, named relationships or channels they can activate
- Evidence of recent successful outcomes (last 2 years)
- Can articulate exactly how they will contribute

*Examples:*
- LP who has committed capital to similar studios
- Advisor who sourced 3+ deals that closed in last year
- Distribution partner with active customer relationships in target market

**18-24 points: Solves Constraint, Mechanism Less Proven**
- Logical path to constraint solution exists
- Network or capabilities suggest potential
- Less recent evidence or unproven in BH context
- May require activation or relationship building

*Examples:*
- Former executive at target customer company (but hasn't made introductions yet)
- Investor with relevant portfolio (but hasn't sourced deals for studios before)
- Sales leader with industry relationships (but in adjacent, not exact market)

**10-17 points: Partial Fit, Secondary Benefit**
- Tangential connection to constraint
- Could potentially help but not primary value
- Would require significant effort to activate
- Value proposition less clear

*Examples:*
- Marketing executive (could help brand but not primary constraint)
- Technical advisor (valuable but doesn't solve Capital/Deal Flow/Distribution)
- Industry analyst (credibility but unclear conversion path)

**0-9 points: No Clear Constraint Fit**
- Cannot articulate path to solving any constraint
- Value proposition is vague or aspirational
- "Nice to have" relationship without clear leverage

## Track Record (25 points)

**What we're measuring:** Evidence of past success in similar partnership contexts.

### Scoring Criteria

**20-25 points: Documented Success, Measurable Outcomes**
- Specific examples with quantified results
- References available and verifiable
- Success in similar partnership structures
- Consistent pattern of delivery

*Evidence to look for:*
- Named deals/investments they sourced
- Revenue attributed to their contributions
- Companies they've helped scale
- Testimonials from partners they've worked with

**14-19 points: Some Experience, Mixed or Unclear Results**
- Relevant experience exists
- Outcomes harder to quantify or attribute
- Mixed track record or limited sample size
- Success in different contexts

*Evidence to look for:*
- General career success in relevant domain
- Anecdotal evidence of helpful contributions
- Partial attribution in team successes
- Success in larger organization context

**7-13 points: Limited Relevant Track Record**
- New to advisory/partnership roles
- Experience in different domains
- Potential but unproven
- Career trajectory suggests capability

**0-6 points: No Experience or Negative Signals**
- No relevant partnership experience
- Failed previous partnerships
- Negative references
- Pattern of over-promising, under-delivering

## Network Quality (20 points)

**What we're measuring:** Relevance and depth of relationships to BH needs.

### Scoring Criteria

**16-20 points: Deep, Relevant Relationships**
- Direct access to decision-makers BH needs to reach
- Relationships are current and active (engaged in last 6 months)
- Can make warm introductions (not just "I know of them")
- Network spans multiple valuable nodes

*Indicators:*
- Can name specific people and context of relationship
- Has made introductions for others recently
- Relationships are reciprocal (they reach out to partner too)
- LinkedIn/social evidence of real engagement

**11-15 points: Good Network, Some Relevance Gaps**
- Strong network in general
- Some relationships directly relevant to BH
- May need to build bridges to most valuable nodes
- Relationships may be older or less active

*Indicators:*
- General industry connectivity
- Some relevant contacts but not comprehensive
- Would need to reactivate some relationships
- Network better in some areas than others

**6-10 points: Network Relevance Unclear**
- Network exists but mapping to BH needs uncertain
- Different industry or geography
- Relationships may be superficial
- Would require significant discovery to assess

**0-5 points: Limited or Irrelevant Network**
- Small professional network
- Network in unrelated domains
- Early career or isolated work history
- Network wouldn't help BH priorities

## Alignment (15 points)

**What we're measuring:** Cultural fit, values, and long-term orientation.

### Scoring Criteria

**12-15 points: Strong Cultural Fit**
- Shares BH values (first-principles, execution bias, long-term thinking)
- Similar communication style and working preferences
- Intrinsically motivated by BH mission
- Previous signals of loyalty and commitment

*Indicators:*
- Expresses genuine interest in BH ventures (not just equity)
- Asks thoughtful questions about mission and approach
- Long tenure in previous roles
- References speak to character and reliability

**8-11 points: Generally Aligned**
- Values broadly compatible
- Some style differences but manageable
- Motivated by reasonable mix of factors
- No major red flags

*Indicators:*
- Professional and engaged in conversations
- Reasonable expectations and asks
- Some evidence of long-term thinking
- Minor concerns but nothing disqualifying

**4-7 points: Alignment Concerns**
- Some values misalignment
- Short-term oriented or purely transactional
- Communication style friction
- May require extra management

*Indicators:*
- Focuses primarily on compensation/equity
- Pattern of short stints
- Pushback on performance milestones
- Different working style than BH team

**0-3 points: Significant Alignment Risks**
- Clear values mismatch
- Purely mercenary motivation
- Reputational concerns
- Would create team friction

## Availability (10 points)

**What we're measuring:** Realistic capacity to contribute given other commitments.

### Scoring Criteria

**8-10 points: Clear Capacity**
- BH would be among top 3 priorities
- Willing to commit specific time
- No conflicting obligations
- Can respond quickly when needed

*Indicators:*
- Limited current advisory roles (fewer than 3)
- Between roles or transitioning
- Explicitly prioritizing BH-type work
- Responsive in initial conversations

**5-7 points: Available with Competing Commitments**
- Has capacity but BH is one of several priorities
- Full-time role but manageable advisory load
- Would need to schedule carefully
- Generally reliable but not always fast

*Indicators:*
- 3-5 current advisory roles
- Active in full-time role
- States they can make time
- Reasonable but not exceptional responsiveness

**2-4 points: Limited Availability**
- Heavy existing commitments
- BH would be lower priority
- Concerns about follow-through
- Response times already slow

*Indicators:*
- 5+ advisory roles
- Demanding full-time role
- Slow to respond in evaluation process
- Hedges on time commitments

**0-1 points: Overcommitted**
- Cannot realistically add BH
- Would be equity dilution without contribution
- Already stretched thin
- History of ghosting or under-delivering
