# Being Human Partner Strategy - Executive Summary v2
## CORRECTED: Net Offset Service Exchange Model

**Date:** February 1, 2026
**Status:** Corrected with Dynamic Formulas

---

## Critical Correction: How the Deal Actually Works

### ❌ INCORRECT (Original Understanding)
- BHP gets equity for their services
- BH gets equity for their services
- Both parties exchange equity

### ✅ CORRECT (Actual Structure)

**Net Offset Model:**
```
BHP provides services worth: $X
BH provides services worth: $Y
Net difference: $X - $Y
This difference converts to BH equity at valuation cap
```

**Example:**
- BHP Services: $150,000
- BH Services: $50,000
- **Net: $100,000**
- At $12M cap: **$100K / $12M = 0.83% BH equity to Beach House**

**No cash changes hands. BHP receives equity for the net service differential.**

---

## Updated Beach House Deal Structure

### Part 1: Corporate Service Exchange (Formula-Based)

**Formula:**
```
BHP_Corporate_Equity_% = ((BHP_Services - BH_Services) / BH_Valuation) × 100
```

**Example Calculation:**
- BHP Services: $150,000 (storytelling for WonderCast, Luminary, BH brand)
- BH Services: $50,000 (AI playground consultation)
- BH Valuation: $12,000,000
- **BHP Corporate Equity: 0.83%**

**This is SEPARATE from personal advisory equity.**

---

### Part 2: Personal Advisory Equity (Negotiable)

**Their Request:**
- Jocelyn & Donovan: 5% combined personal advisory
- Plus corporate (0.83%)
- **Total: 5.83% studio dilution**

**Our Recommendation:**
- Jocelyn: 0.75% studio equity
- Donovan: 0.5% studio + 1.0-1.5% per media venture
- Plus corporate (0.83%)
- **Total: 2.08% studio dilution**

---

## Updated Cap Table Impact

### Formula for Total Dilution

```
Total_Dilution = BHP_Corporate_% + Jocelyn_% + Donovan_%
Growth_Pool_Remaining = 15% - Total_Dilution - Other_Partners_%
```

### Scenario Comparison

| Scenario | Corporate | Personal | Total | Remaining Pool | Impact |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|----------------|---------|
| **Accept Full Request** | 0.83% | 5.0% | **5.83%** | 8.67% | ❌ 39% of pool consumed |
| **Our Recommendation** | 0.83% | 1.25% | **2.08%** | 12.42% | ✅ 14% of pool consumed |
| **Compromise** | 0.83% | 2.5% | **3.33%** | 11.17% | ⚠️ 22% of pool consumed |

**Current allocation:** 0.5% (Gay Chee Cheong) + Beach House = Total allocated

## Immediate Decisions Required

### Decision 1: Service Values (Define These First)

**Beach House Services - What do we actually need?**
- [ ] WonderCast launch package only? ($75K)
- [ ] WonderCast + Luminary brand development? ($125K)
- [ ] Full year with ongoing content? ($150K+)
- [ ] Multi-year with 3+ ventures? ($200K+)

**Being Human Services - How deep do we go?**
- [ ] Strategy consultation only? ($25K)
- [ ] Strategy + roadmap + guidance? ($50K)
- [ ] Full implementation support? ($100K+)

**Resulting Corporate Equity:**
- Use formula: `(BHP_Value - BH_Value) / $12M`
- See Calculator for quick reference table

---

### Decision 2: Personal Advisory Counter-Offer

**Options:**

| Option | Jocelyn | Donovan | Total Personal | Total w/ Corporate | Rationale |
|--------|---------|---------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **A (Firm)** | 0.75% | 0.5% | 1.25% | 2.08% | Recommended - preserves capacity |
| **B (Flexible)** | 1.0% | 1.0% | 2.0% | 2.83% | Compromise if they push back |
| **C (Maximum)** | 1.5% | 1.5% | 3.0% | 3.83% | Ceiling before walking away |
| **D (Walk)** | - | - | 0% | 0.83% | Corporate only, defer personal |

**Factors to consider:**
- Network overlap (90%+ shared)
- Constraint priority (they solve #3, need #1-2 more)
- Remaining capacity for tech/capital partners

---

### Decision 3: Donovan Studio vs. Venture Split

**For Donovan specifically - where should his equity come from?**

| Approach | Studio % | WonderCast % | Luminary % | Total Value Potential |
|----------|----------|--------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Studio-Heavy** | 1.0% | 0.5% | 0.5% | Broad exposure |
| **Balanced (Rec)** | 0.5% | 1.0% | 1.25% | Aligns with creative impact |
| **Venture-Heavy** | 0.25% | 1.5% | 1.5% | Concentrated upside |
| **Venture-Only** | 0% | 2.0% | 2.0% | Max venture exposure |

**Trade-off:** Studio = dilutes across all ventures; Venture = concentrated in ventures he shapes

## Updated Action Items

### This Week (Kyle)

**1. Define Service Scopes & Values**
- [ ] Determine BHP deliverables (WonderCast? Luminary? Ongoing?)
- [ ] Assign dollar value ($100K? $150K? $200K?)
- [ ] Determine BH deliverables (Strategy only? Implementation?)
- [ ] Assign dollar value ($25K? $50K? $100K?)
- [ ] Calculate corporate equity using formula

**2. Decide on Personal Advisory Counter**
- [ ] Choose option A/B/C/D from table above
- [ ] Justify: "Why this % given overlap and constraint priorities?"

**3. Prepare for Negotiation**
- [ ] Review Beach_House_Negotiation_Guide.md
- [ ] Use Beach_House_Deal_Calculator.md for scenario modeling
- [ ] Schedule call with Jocelyn & Donovan

---

### Next Week (Negotiation)

**1. Present Structure Clearly**
> "Two separate components:
> 1. Corporate service exchange: BHP provides $X services, BH provides $Y, difference converts to Z% equity
> 2. Personal advisory: Separate evaluation and equity allocation"

**2. Accept Corporate Component**
> "The service exchange makes sense - let's lock that in at [calculated %]"

**3. Counter on Personal**
> "For personal advisory, we're offering [X%] combined, structured as..."

**4. Use Calculator in Real-Time**
- Plug in different service values
- Show cap table impact live
- Model scenarios together

## Quick Formula Reference

### Corporate Equity (Service Swap)
```
Corporate_% = ((BHP_Services - BH_Services) / BH_Valuation) × 100

Example:
($150,000 - $50,000) / $12,000,000 × 100 = 0.83%
```

### Total Dilution
```
Total_% = Corporate_% + Jocelyn_% + Donovan_%

Example:
0.83% + 0.75% + 0.5% = 2.08%
```

### Remaining Capacity
```
Remaining_% = 15% - Total_Allocated_%

Example:
15% - 2.08% - 0.5% (Gay) = 12.42%
```

### Decision Threshold
```
If Total_% > 4.0%: Consider walking away from personal advisory
If Total_% > 6.0%: Definitely walk away
```

## What Changed from v1

### ❌ v1 (Incorrect)
- Both parties exchange equity for services
- BHP gets equity in BH, BH gets equity in AI Playground venture
- Double equity exchange model

### ✅ v2 (Correct)
- **Net offset:** Only the *difference* in service values converts to equity
- BHP receives BH equity for the net differential
- BH receives services (not equity)
- Single equity conversion (BH → BHP)

### Impact on Numbers
- **v1 calculation:** 2.5% for $400K services → WRONG
- **v2 calculation:** 0.83% for $100K net differential → CORRECT

All framework and evaluation methodology remains valid - only the corporate equity calculation changed.

---

## Success Metrics

### If You Accept Corporate (0.83%) + Counter Personal (1.25%) = 2.08% Total

**Remaining Capacity:** 12.42%

**Can Still Afford:**
- ✅ 3-4 strategic advisors (tech, capital focus) - 3-4%
- ✅ 2-3 capital partners ($100-250K each) - 2.5-3.5%
- ✅ 1-2 domain experts - 1.5-2%
- ✅ 1 enterprise GTM partner - 1.5%
- ✅ Reserve for opportunistic - 3-4%

**Result:** Complete partner portfolio solving all three constraints

---

### If You Accept Corporate (0.83%) + Full Request (5.0%) = 5.83% Total

**Remaining Capacity:** 8.67%

**Can Only Afford:**
- ⚠️ 2 strategic advisors (forced to choose types) - 2%
- ⚠️ 1-2 capital partners (smaller checks) - 1.5-2%
- ❌ Maybe 1 domain expert - 1%
- ❌ No enterprise GTM
- ⚠️ Minimal reserve - 2-3%

**Result:** Incomplete portfolio, #1 constraint (Capital) under-solved

---

## Recommended Position

**Accept:** Corporate service exchange at calculated % (formula-based)

**Counter:** Personal advisory at 1.25% combined (vs. 5% requested)

**Walk-Away:** If personal exceeds 3.0%, accept corporate only and defer personal advisory

**Rationale:**
- Corporate equity (0.83%) fair for services rendered
- Personal equity must preserve capacity for tech/capital partners
- Network overlap (90%) justifies lower combined allocation
- Total dilution target: <3% to maintain strategic flexibility

---

## Next Steps

1. **Define service values** (BHP: $? | BH: $?)
2. **Calculate corporate equity** using formula
3. **Decide personal counter** (Option A/B/C/D)
4. **Review negotiation guide**
5. **Schedule call** with Jocelyn & Donovan
6. **Use calculator** during negotiation for real-time modeling

**All tools ready. Awaiting your service value inputs to finalize calculations.**
