# Beach House Pictures Partnership - Comparative Evaluation Summary

**Evaluation Date:** February 1, 2026
**Evaluator:** Claude + Kyle Jackson
**Status:** Strategic Recommendation for Three-Party Partnership

---

## Executive Summary

Beach House Pictures presents a **three-layered partnership opportunity** with complementary but potentially overlapping value propositions. After independent evaluation of all parties using BH's partner framework, we recommend pursuing **selective engagement** rather than the full package as proposed:

| Party | Recommended Action | Structure | Rationale |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Beach House Pictures** | **PURSUE** | Corporate Service Exchange (12-month pilot) | High value, proven track record, clear deliverables |
| **Jocelyn Little** | **PURSUE (Modified Terms)** | 0.4% studio equity, performance-gated | Strong business development value, network quality |
| **Donovan Chan** | **DEFER** | Venture-specific equity only (if pursuing) | Value overlaps with BHP corporate partnership |

**Key Insight:** The proposal risks triple-paying for overlapping value (BHP corporate services + Jocelyn advisory + Donovan advisory + potential investment). Recommend prioritizing BHP corporate partnership + Jocelyn advisory, deferring Donovan to venture-specific equity for media ventures only.

## Comparative Scoring

| Dimension | Beach House Pictures | Jocelyn Little | Donovan Chan |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Constraint Fit** | 24/30 | 23/30 | 21/30 |
| **Track Record** | 22/25 | 20/25 | 21/25 |
| **Network Quality** | 17/20 | 16/20 | 14/20 |
| **Alignment** | 12/15 | 12/15 | 13/15 |
| **Availability** | 7/10 | 7/10 | 7/10 |
| **TOTAL** | **82/100** | **78/100** | **76/100** |
| **Tier** | **Tier 2** | **Tier 2** | **Tier 2** |
| **Recommendation** | Strong Candidate | Strong Candidate | Strong Candidate |

**Analysis:** All three score as Tier 2 partners (75-84 range), indicating "Strong Candidate" status. However, scores alone don't account for overlap and risk of paying multiple times for same networks and expertise.

## Constraint Fit Analysis

### Primary Constraints Solved

| Party | Capital Access | Deal Flow | Distribution/GTM |
|-------|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| **BHP** | Indirect | Indirect | **Direct** ✓ |
| **Jocelyn** | Indirect | **Direct** ✓ | **Direct** ✓ |
| **Donovan** | None | Indirect | **Direct** ✓ |

**Observation:** All three primarily solve Distribution/GTM through storytelling, media relationships, and content creation. Only Jocelyn directly addresses Deal Flow (media industry partnerships, business development).

**Implication:** Strong alignment on Distribution constraint, but potential redundancy. BH should layer these relationships to avoid overlap:
1. **BHP** provides execution capacity (production services)
2. **Jocelyn** provides strategic partnerships (platform deals, business development)
3. **Donovan** provides creative vision (narrative strategy for specific ventures)

---

## Network Overlap Analysis

### Shared Networks (High Overlap Risk)

| Network Category | BHP | Jocelyn | Donovan |
|-----------------|-----|---------|---------|
| **Fremantle** | ✓ (Corporate parent) | ✓ (Via BHP) | ✓ (Via BHP) |
| **Netflix** | ✓ (Production partner) | ✓ (Platform relationship) | ✓ (Creative relationship) |
| **Amazon Prime** | ✓ (Production partner) | ✓ (Platform relationship) | ✓ (Creative relationship) |
| **Nat Geo / Discovery** | ✓ (Production partner) | ✓ (Platform relationship) | ✓ (Creative relationship) |
| **Asian Broadcasters** | ✓ (Production clients) | ✓ (Business development) | ✓ (Creative partnerships) |

**Risk Assessment:** 90%+ network overlap between all three parties. Jocelyn and Donovan are married co-founders of BHP, so their networks are essentially identical. BH risks paying three times for access to same relationships.

### Unique Value Differentiation

| Party | What They Bring That Others Don't |
|-------|-----------------------------------|
| **BHP** | Production capacity, Fremantle corporate distribution, execution ability |
| **Jocelyn** | Business development expertise, operational scaling guidance, dealmaking experience (VHQ TV, BHP growth, Fremantle acquisition) |
| **Donovan** | Creative excellence, narrative strategy, Emmy-level storytelling quality standards |

**Recommendation:** Structure relationships to leverage unique value only, minimize paying for overlapping networks.

## Proposed Partnership Structures (Comparison)

### Original Proposal vs. Recommended Structure

| Element | Original Proposal | BH Evaluation Recommendation |
|---------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **BHP Corporate** | Mutual offset service exchange, unspecified value | **12-month pilot, S$150-250K equivalent each side, renewable** |
| **Jocelyn Equity** | 0.5-1.0% studio equity, 2-year vest with 6-month cliff | **0.4% studio equity, 24-month performance-gated vesting** |
| **Donovan Equity** | 0.5-1.0% studio equity (joint with Jocelyn), 2-year vest | **Defer studio equity; offer venture-specific equity for WonderCast/Luminary only** |
| **Investment** | $100K-500K SAFE at $12M cap | **Separate decision; not tied to advisory or corporate partnership** |

### Recommended Tiered Approach

**Phase 1: Corporate Partnership (Immediate)**
- Execute 12-month pilot of BHP corporate service exchange
- Validate value symmetry (AI ops support ↔ storytelling services)
- Clear deliverables and milestones
- Decision point at 12 months: renew, adjust, or terminate

**Phase 2: Jocelyn Advisory (Contingent on Phase 1 Success)**
- After 6 months of successful corporate partnership, formalize Jocelyn advisory
- 0.4% studio equity with performance-gated milestones
- Focus on introductions and partnerships that BHP wouldn't deliver corporately
- Clear separation: Jocelyn advises on business development, BHP delivers production services

**Phase 3: Donovan Venture-Specific (Optional)**
- If WonderCast or Luminary require significant creative input beyond BHP's corporate deliverables
- Offer venture-specific equity (1.0-1.5% per venture)
- Keep separate from studio equity to avoid overlap

**Phase 4: Investment Discussion (Independent)**
- Evaluate investment opportunity on its own merits
- Not bundled with advisory or corporate partnership
- Standard SAFE terms based on BH's current fundraising strategy

## Detailed Recommendations by Party

### 1. Beach House Pictures (Corporate)

**Recommendation: PURSUE - Corporate Service Exchange**

**Proposed Terms:**
- **Structure:** Mutual offset agreement (AI Operations Support ↔ Storytellers in Residence)
- **Value:** S$150-250K equivalent each direction
- **Duration:** 12-month initial term, renewable annually with 90-day notice
- **Deliverables:**
  - BH → BHP: Workflow assessment, AI tool implementation, team training, custom automation
  - BHP → BH: Launch storytelling for 2-3 ventures, ongoing content, brand consulting

**Milestones:**
| Quarter | BH Deliverables | BHP Deliverables |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Q1 | Production workflow assessment, AI roadmap | WonderCast launch storytelling package |
| Q2 | First AI tool implementation, training session | Luminary brand narrative, content assets |
| Q3 | Second AI implementation, optimization | BH studio thought leadership content |
| Q4 | Custom automation, performance review | Portfolio review, renewal planning |

**Why Pursue:**
1. Clear mutual value - both parties need what the other offers
2. Proven production excellence (Emmy-nominated, Netflix hits)
3. Fremantle distribution leverage valuable for BH ventures
4. Service exchange minimizes cash outlay
5. Renewable structure allows exit if not delivering

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Start with 12-month pilot vs. multi-year commitment
- Clear deliverables and SLAs with remedies for non-delivery
- Separate from advisory/investment discussions (can succeed independently)
- Include IMDA subsidy exploration to reduce net costs

**Next Steps:**
1. Scope both pillars (AI ops + storytelling) to confirm value symmetry
2. Define specific deliverables with acceptance criteria
3. Draft service agreement with Fremantle approval
4. Launch Q1 2026 with WonderCast storytelling as first deliverable

---

### 2. Jocelyn Little (Personal Advisory)

**Recommendation: PURSUE - Modified Terms (0.4% vs. 0.5-1.0% proposed)**

**Proposed Terms:**
- **Position:** Strategic Advisor (personal capacity, separate from BHP)
- **Equity:** 0.4% Being Human studio equity
- **Vesting:** 24 months, performance-gated (not time-based)
- **Focus:** Business development, strategic partnerships, operational guidance

**Performance-Gated Milestones:**
| Tranche | % | Timeline | Milestone |
|---------|---|----------|-----------|
| Cliff | 25% (0.1%) | 6 months | 3 qualified media industry introductions that result in meetings |
| T2 | 25% (0.1%) | 12 months | 1 introduction converts to signed engagement OR significant brand presence in media industry |
| T3 | 25% (0.1%) | 18 months | Cumulative 2 conversions OR $250K+ revenue from sourced opportunities |
| T4 | 25% (0.1%) | 24 months | Cumulative 3 conversions OR major strategic partnership formalized |

**Acceleration:** $500K+ revenue from Jocelyn's introductions = immediate full vest

**Why 0.4% (vs. 0.5-1.0% proposed):**
- Network overlap with BHP corporate partnership (same platforms, same Fremantle access)
- Unproven in venture studio advisory context (exceptional in media/production, but different model)
- Availability constraints (MD of active production company + Fremantle integration)
- Mid-range positioning allows increase via acceleration if she over-delivers

**Why Pursue Despite Overlap:**
1. Operational expertise from building two production companies (VHQ TV, BHP)
2. Business development and dealmaking experience (Fremantle acquisition, platform partnerships)
3. Singapore ecosystem connections (IMDA, government, local investors)
4. Industry credibility (International Academy of TV Arts & Sciences member)
5. Complementary to BHP corporate partnership (strategic vs. execution)

**Separation from BHP Corporate Partnership:**
- BHP delivers production services (corporate contract)
- Jocelyn provides strategic partnerships and business development (personal advisory)
- Both can succeed independently; if BHP partnership ends, Jocelyn advisory continues
- Milestones focus on introductions BHP wouldn't make in normal course of business

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Performance-gated milestones ensure she earns equity by delivering results
- 6-month cliff provides opt-out if capacity or value doesn't materialize
- Lower equity allocation (0.4% vs. 0.75%+) accounts for overlap risk
- Clear deliverables separate from BHP corporate contract

**Next Steps:**
1. Confirm Fremantle approves external advisory work
2. Map specific introductions she can make (platform decision-makers, strategic partners)
3. Define separation from BHP corporate partnership in writing
4. Consider joint structure with Donovan (see below)

---

### 3. Donovan Chan (Personal Advisory)

**Recommendation: DEFER Studio Equity - Offer Venture-Specific Equity Only**

**Rationale for Deferral:**
- Primary value (creative storytelling) is being purchased via BHP corporate partnership
- Creative Director role overlaps 90%+ with BHP's "Storytellers in Residence" services
- Risk of double-paying for same creative expertise
- Networks (creative side) less relevant to BH studio-level needs than Jocelyn's business networks

**Alternative Structure: Venture-Specific Equity**

Instead of studio equity, offer Donovan equity in specific ventures where creative contribution is core:

**WonderCast:**
- **Equity:** 1.0% venture equity
- **Role:** Creative vision for AI storytelling features, narrative quality standards, parent-child connection storytelling
- **Milestones:** Brand narrative delivered (+0.25%), content strategy implemented (+0.25%), engagement lift (+0.25%), sustained performance (+0.25%)

**Luminary:**
- **Equity:** 1.25% venture equity
- **Role:** World-building methodology, experiential storytelling design, narrative frameworks for imagined/heritage worlds
- **Milestones:** Creative strategy delivered (+0.3125%), experience design implemented (+0.3125%), user engagement metrics (+0.3125%), scaled implementation (+0.3125%)

**Why Venture-Specific is Better:**
1. Aligns incentives with ventures where creative expertise is most valuable
2. Avoids overlap with BHP corporate partnership (studio-level vs. venture-level)
3. Provides significant upside if creative contributions drive venture success
4. Reduces studio equity dilution
5. Clear differentiation: BHP produces content, Donovan provides strategic creative vision

**When to Reconsider Studio Equity:**
- If Donovan's creative guidance proves valuable across portfolio (not just media ventures)
- If he brings unique networks or relationships separate from BHP
- If he provides strategic value beyond what BHP delivers corporately
- Then consider 0.25-0.35% studio equity as baseline creative advisor

**Next Steps:**
1. Defer studio equity discussion
2. If pursuing WonderCast or Luminary creative advisory, scope specific role
3. Define venture-specific milestones tied to measurable creative impact
4. Consider joint structure with Jocelyn (see below)

---

## Joint Advisory Structure (Jocelyn + Donovan)

**Alternative Recommendation: Joint Advisory at Combined Lower Allocation**

Given Jocelyn and Donovan are married co-founders with 90%+ overlapping networks, consider structuring as joint advisory:

**Joint Structure Option:**
- **Combined Studio Equity:** 0.6% total (Jocelyn 0.35%, Donovan 0.25%)
- **Plus Venture-Specific:** Donovan gets additional venture equity for WonderCast/Luminary
- **Shared Milestones:** Some conversions can be credited to either or both
- **Individual Responsibilities:** Jocelyn = business development, Donovan = creative strategy

**Advantages:**
- Recognizes they share networks (married co-founders of same company)
- Values their complementary expertise without double-paying
- Total dilution 0.6% studio + venture-specific vs. 0.8-2.0% if evaluated separately
- Flexibility: they coordinate on delivering milestones together

**Structure:**
| Person | Studio Equity | Focus | Venture-Specific |
|--------|---------------|-------|------------------|
| Jocelyn | 0.35% | Business development, strategic partnerships, operational guidance | None |
| Donovan | 0.25% | Creative strategy, brand narrative, content quality standards | +1.0% WonderCast, +1.25% Luminary |

**Combined Milestones (0.6% studio equity):**
- **Cliff (25% = 0.15%):** 3 qualified introductions + creative strategy for 1 venture
- **T2 (25% = 0.15%):** 1 conversion OR brand lift in media industry
- **T3 (25% = 0.15%):** 2 conversions OR major strategic partnership
- **T4 (25% = 0.15%):** 3 conversions OR portfolio-level brand elevation

**Individual Milestones (venture-specific for Donovan):**
- Donovan earns WonderCast/Luminary equity independently based on creative deliverables
- Jocelyn can assist but these are Donovan's milestones

## Investment Opportunity (Separate Evaluation)

**Recommendation: Evaluate Independently, Not Bundled**

The proposal includes potential investment of $100K-500K via SAFE at $12M cap. This should be evaluated separately from advisory and corporate partnerships.

**Investment Pros:**
- Media industry investor brings validation and credibility
- Fremantle networks could assist with fundraising or strategic partnerships
- Financial alignment across advisory and capital
- Singapore-based investor aligned with BH geography

**Investment Cons:**
- $12M cap may be aggressive depending on BH's current traction and comparable valuations
- Bundling investment with advisory creates complexity (if advisory doesn't work out, is investment contingent?)
- Jocelyn/Donovan are not professional investors - this is personal capital deployment
- Unclear what strategic value investment brings beyond advisory (which is already compensated via equity)

**Recommendation:**
1. **Decouple** investment from advisory and corporate partnership discussions
2. **Evaluate** investment on standard terms based on BH's fundraising strategy
3. **Consider** whether $100-500K check size justifies complexity of multiple relationships
4. **Alternative:** If they want investment alignment, consider SAFE + smaller advisory equity (e.g., 0.25% vs. 0.4%)

**If Pursuing Investment:**
- Standard SAFE terms (don't offer preferential terms because of other relationships)
- Pro-rata rights and information rights are reasonable
- Ensure no conflicts with Fremantle investment policies
- Keep investment agreement separate from advisory agreement (can terminate one without affecting other)

## Strategic Recommendations

### Recommended Sequencing

**Immediate (February 2026):**
1. **Execute BHP corporate partnership pilot** (12 months, mutual offset)
2. **Defer advisory discussions** until corporate partnership proves successful (6 months)

**6-Month Review (August 2026):**
3. **Evaluate BHP corporate partnership performance**
   - Is storytelling value meeting expectations?
   - Is AI operations support delivering impact?
   - Should we renew, adjust, or terminate?

4. **If successful, formalize Jocelyn advisory**
   - 0.4% studio equity with performance-gated milestones
   - Clear separation from BHP corporate deliverables
   - Focus on business development and strategic partnerships

**12-Month Review (February 2027):**
5. **Assess whether Donovan venture-specific equity is needed**
   - Has WonderCast/Luminary creative needs exceeded BHP corporate deliverables?
   - Is strategic creative vision required beyond project-based production?
   - If yes, offer venture-specific equity; if no, continue with BHP corporate only

6. **Investment discussion (if applicable)**
   - Evaluate on independent terms based on BH fundraising needs
   - Don't bundle with advisory or corporate partnerships

### Why Staged Approach is Better

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Test BHP corporate partnership before adding personal advisory relationships
- Validate value delivery before committing to equity dilution
- Identify actual needs vs. proposed structure
- Build trust and working relationship over time

**Flexibility:**
- Can adjust terms based on actual performance
- Not locked into 2-year equity vesting if relationship doesn't work
- Easier to add complexity than remove it
- Each relationship can succeed or fail independently

**Focus:**
- Start with highest-value, lowest-risk opportunity (BHP corporate partnership)
- Layer in personal advisory only if corporate partnership proves complementary value
- Avoid overwhelming partnerships at outset

---

## Key Decision Points

### Critical Questions to Answer

1. **Overlap Management:**
   - How do we ensure BHP corporate partnership and personal advisory equity don't pay for same value?
   - What introductions/guidance would Jocelyn/Donovan provide that BHP wouldn't?
   - Can we get same value from BHP corporate partnership alone?

2. **Fremantle Dynamics:**
   - Does Fremantle approve external advisory work by BHP co-founders?
   - Could Fremantle integration change BHP's ability to deliver on corporate partnership?
   - Are there conflicts between BH ventures and Fremantle portfolio?

3. **Equity Allocation:**
   - Is 0.4-0.75% studio equity appropriate for Tier 2 advisors with 90% network overlap?
   - Should we use venture-specific equity instead of studio equity for Donovan?
   - What's total dilution across all three relationships (corporate + 2 advisors + potential investment)?

4. **Investment Bundling:**
   - Should investment be bundled with advisory, or evaluated separately?
   - Does $100-500K check size justify relationship complexity?
   - Would investment create conflicts or complications?

### Red Flags to Watch

**Corporate Partnership:**
- ❌ BHP unable to dedicate resources due to competing Fremantle priorities
- ❌ Value asymmetry (one side delivers more than other, causing friction)
- ❌ AI operations support isn't valuable to BHP production workflows
- ❌ Storytelling quality doesn't meet BH expectations

**Personal Advisory:**
- ❌ Introductions duplicate what BHP corporate partnership already provides
- ❌ Jocelyn/Donovan can't carve out time given MD/Creative Director responsibilities
- ❌ Fremantle restricts external advisory work
- ❌ Milestones not being met (no conversions from introductions)

**Investment:**
- ❌ Bundling investment with advisory creates conflicts
- ❌ Personal capital deployment strains Jocelyn/Donovan's finances
- ❌ $12M cap misaligned with BH's actual valuation and traction

## Final Recommendation Summary

| Opportunity | Status | Structure | Rationale |
|-------------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **BHP Corporate Partnership** | ✅ **PURSUE** | 12-month pilot, S$150-250K mutual offset, renewable | Highest value, clear deliverables, proven track record |
| **Jocelyn Advisory** | ⚠️ **PURSUE (Modified)** | 0.4% studio equity, 24-month performance-gated vest | Strong business development value, but overlap risk |
| **Donovan Advisory** | ⏸️ **DEFER** | Venture-specific equity only (WonderCast/Luminary) | Value overlaps with BHP corporate; offer venture equity if needed |
| **Investment** | ⏸️ **DEFER** | Evaluate separately, not bundled | Decouple from advisory and corporate partnerships |

**Recommended Total Equity Dilution:**
- BHP Corporate: 0% (service exchange, no equity)
- Jocelyn Advisory: 0.4% studio equity
- Donovan Venture-Specific: 1.0-1.25% per media venture (not studio equity)
- Investment: TBD based on separate evaluation

**Total Studio Dilution: 0.4%** (vs. 1.0-2.0% in original proposal)

**Total Venture Dilution (WonderCast/Luminary): 1.0-1.25%** (only if Donovan creative advisory is needed beyond BHP corporate deliverables)

---

## Conclusion

Beach House Pictures partnership presents real value, but the three-party structure as proposed risks significant equity dilution for overlapping networks and expertise. Recommend:

1. **Lead with corporate partnership** - Highest value, lowest risk
2. **Add Jocelyn advisory** - If corporate partnership succeeds and she brings unique business development value
3. **Defer Donovan studio equity** - Offer venture-specific equity only if creative needs exceed BHP corporate deliverables
4. **Separate investment** - Evaluate on independent terms, don't bundle

This staged approach reduces risk, validates value delivery before equity commitment, and minimizes overlap costs while preserving upside if partnerships exceed expectations.

---

**Next Step:** Schedule discovery conversation to discuss which opportunities resonate and propose staged approach vs. bundled package.
