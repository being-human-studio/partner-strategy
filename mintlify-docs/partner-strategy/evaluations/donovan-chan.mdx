# Partner Evaluation: Donovan Chan

## Summary
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Partner** | Donovan Chan, Creative Director & Co-Founder, Beach House Pictures |
| **Type** | Brand & Storytelling Partner / Domain Expert |
| **Evaluation Date** | February 1, 2026 |
| **Evaluator** | Claude + Kyle Jackson |

## Recommendation
**Score: 76/100** | **Tier: 2** | **Action: Strong Candidate - Active Pursuit**

Donovan Chan brings world-class creative and storytelling expertise with Emmy-nominated productions and 200M+ view content. As Creative Director overseeing all Beach House Pictures content creation, he has deep expertise in narrative structure, documentary filmmaking, and branded content - directly addressing BH's Distribution/GTM constraint through compelling storytelling. However, his primary value overlaps significantly with the Beach House Pictures corporate partnership (Storytellers in Residence). Recommend positioning as Brand & Storytelling advisor at lower end of range (0.25-0.5% studio equity) with performance milestones tied to creative guidance that goes beyond what BHP provides corporately.

## Constraint Analysis

| Constraint | Fit Level | Evidence |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Capital Access | None | Creative professional, no investment networks identified |
| Deal Flow | Indirect | Media industry creative relationships; potential to identify content/media ventures; less relevant for BH's broader tech venture focus |
| Distribution/GTM | **Direct** | Emmy-nominated storytelling, 200M+ reach demonstrated (China From Above), proven ability to create narratives that resonate at scale, content expertise drives distribution success |

**Primary Constraint Solved:** Distribution/GTM through world-class creative storytelling and content creation

## Scoring Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Constraint Fit | 21/30 | Directly solves Distribution through compelling narrative creation; proven ability to create content that scales (200M+ views); however, this value overlaps heavily with BHP corporate partnership where BH is already contracting for storytelling services |
| Track Record | 21/25 | Exceptional creative track record - Emmy nomination, multiple award wins, consistent delivery over 20+ years; proven at scale (200M+ China From Above); worked with major platforms (Netflix, Nat Geo, Discovery) |
| Network Quality | 14/20 | Strong creative and production networks (talent, directors, production partners); less relevant to BH's primary needs (investors, enterprise customers, strategic partners); network strength is creative side vs. business side |
| Alignment | 13/15 | Creative excellence mindset aligns with BH quality standards; demonstrated interest in AI-media convergence; entrepreneurial co-founder background; strong cultural fit around innovation and storytelling |
| Availability | 7/10 | Creative Director role at active production company; oversees all BHP content creation and development; significant commitments but creative guidance is more scalable than operational work; can provide strategic creative input without weekly time demands |
| **TOTAL** | **76/100** | |

## Recommended Structure

**Equity Type:** Studio Equity OR Venture Equity (venture-specific for media ventures)
**Equity Range:** 0.25% - 0.75% studio equity
**Recommended Allocation:** 0.35% studio equity
**Alternative Structure:** Venture-specific equity for media ventures (WonderCast, Luminary) at 0.5-1.5% per venture

### Rationale for Lower Range (0.35% vs. Jocelyn's 0.75%)

**Why lower than Jocelyn:**
- Primary value (creative storytelling) is already being delivered through BHP corporate partnership
- Risk of double-paying for same expertise - BH is contracting BHP for "Storytellers in Residence"
- Creative Director networks (talent, production) less relevant to BH studio-level needs than MD networks (platforms, business development)
- Advisory value is narrower (creative guidance only) vs. Jocelyn's broader operational/business development expertise

**Why not zero (rely solely on BHP corporate partnership):**
- Personal creative guidance and narrative strategy valuable beyond project-based deliverables
- Strategic input on which stories to tell, how to position BH ventures, brand narrative development
- Long-term creative vision for BH portfolio (what makes compelling venture stories)
- Ability to contribute creative thinking separate from BHP's corporate production deliverables

**Alternative Structure - Venture-Specific Equity:**
Rather than studio equity, consider positioning Donovan as Brand & Storytelling advisor for specific media ventures:
- WonderCast: 0.75% venture equity (storytelling is core product)
- Luminary: 1.0% venture equity (experiential storytelling is core experience)
- Future media ventures: 0.5-2% per venture based on creative contribution

This structure:
- Aligns Donovan's incentives with ventures where creative expertise is most valuable
- Avoids overlap with BHP corporate partnership (studio-level services)
- Provides upside if his creative input drives venture success
- Reduces BH studio equity dilution

### Performance-Gated Milestone Schedule (Studio Equity - 0.35%)

| Tranche | % of Total | Timeline | Milestone Trigger |
|---------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Cliff | 25% (0.0875%) | 6 months | Creative strategy sessions for 2 BH ventures delivered (narrative frameworks, positioning strategies) |
| T2 | 25% (0.0875%) | 12 months | Measurable brand lift OR content engagement for 1 venture attributable to creative guidance (20%+ vs. baseline) |
| T3 | 25% (0.0875%) | 18 months | 3 ventures with implemented creative strategies OR 1 venture achieves significant brand recognition (media coverage, awards submission, etc.) |
| T4 | 25% (0.0875%) | 24 months | Portfolio-level brand elevation: BH recognized in media/tech industry OR sustained performance across ventures |

### Alternative: Venture-Specific Milestone Schedule (WonderCast Example - 0.75%)

| Tranche | % of Total | Timeline | Milestone Trigger |
|---------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Cliff | 25% (0.1875%) | On delivery | Brand narrative and creative strategy delivered and approved |
| T2 | 25% (0.1875%) | +90 days | Content deployed, engagement baseline established (user feedback, content performance) |
| T3 | 25% (0.1875%) | +6 months | Measurable impact: 20%+ improvement in user engagement OR brand awareness vs. baseline |
| T4 | 25% (0.1875%) | +12 months | Sustained performance OR storytelling features become core product differentiator |

**Acceleration Trigger:** If creative work directly contributes to venture exit or significant funding ($1M+ round), accelerate remaining vesting

## Key Strengths

1. **Emmy-Nominated Creative Excellence** - *Mind Your Manners* Netflix series earned Emmy nomination; demonstrates ability to create content that meets highest quality standards and resonates with global audiences

2. **Proven Scale** - *China From Above* reached 200M+ views on Tencent/Nat Geo; *Missing: The Lucie Blackman Case* hit #1 in UK/US on Netflix; shows ability to create narratives that work at massive scale

3. **Multi-Genre Expertise** - Award-winning work spans documentary (wildlife, true crime, travel), lifestyle, branded content, scripted; versatile creative skillset applicable to various BH venture types

4. **Platform Relationships** - 20+ years working with Netflix, National Geographic, Discovery, Amazon Prime; understands what content works for each platform and how to structure stories for different audiences

5. **Creative Leadership** - Oversees all Beach House Pictures content creation; experience managing creative teams, development pipelines, and production quality standards

## Risk Factors

1. **Overlap with Corporate Partnership** - BH is already contracting Beach House Pictures for "Storytellers in Residence" services; Donovan is Creative Director of BHP; significant risk of paying twice for same creative expertise
   - *Mitigation:* Clearly define Donovan's personal advisory role as strategic creative guidance separate from BHP's project-based production deliverables; focus on narrative strategy, brand positioning, creative vision vs. execution (which BHP handles)

2. **Network Relevance** - Creative networks (directors, talent, production partners) less relevant to BH's primary studio-level needs (investors, strategic partners, enterprise customers)
   - *Mitigation:* Position Donovan as specialist advisor for media/content ventures only; supplement with other advisors for tech/enterprise focus; consider venture-specific equity instead of studio equity

3. **Availability Constraints** - Creative Director overseeing all BHP content; heavy production commitments; may struggle to prioritize BH advisory work
   - *Mitigation:* Structure as quarterly strategic guidance (not weekly involvement); milestone-based vesting ensures he only earns equity by delivering results; creative guidance is more scalable than operational work

4. **Measurement Difficulty** - Creative impact is harder to quantify than business development metrics (can measure conversions, revenue); risk of subjective milestone assessment
   - *Mitigation:* Define milestones with measurable outcomes where possible (engagement lift, brand awareness metrics, media coverage); include "delivered and approved" language to ensure BH team validates quality

5. **Spousal Coordination** - Married to Jocelyn Little (also being evaluated as advisor); joint network means potential overlap in value and risk of double-paying for same relationships
   - *Mitigation:* Consider joint advisory structure where they share equity pool and milestones; alternative: keep separate but at lower total allocation (e.g., 0.35% Donovan + 0.4% Jocelyn = 0.75% total vs. 1.0% each separately)

2. **Talent Relationships** - Potential connections to creators, directors, on-camera talent if needed
3. **Media Industry Insights** - Understanding of content trends, audience preferences, platform strategies

### Strategic Fit with BH Ventures

**WonderCast (Very High Fit):**
- AI-powered storytelling tool - narrative expertise is core product feature
- Bedtime stories and parent-child connection - Donovan's lifestyle/family content experience directly relevant
- Content quality standards - ensuring AI-generated stories meet emotional resonance bar
- Platform positioning - how to market storytelling tool to parents
- **Recommendation:** Venture-specific equity (0.75-1.5%) given high creative contribution to core product

**Luminary (Very High Fit):**
- Experiential AI education center - storytelling is core to "world-building methodology"
- Family entertainment and education - aligns with Donovan's lifestyle/educational content background
- Narrative design - how children create imagined worlds, adults reconstruct heritage worlds
- Documentary potential - "Learning futures" content series opportunity
- **Recommendation:** Venture-specific equity (1.0-1.5%) for creative vision and narrative design

**Kavlo (Low Fit):**
- Enterprise document embeddings - technical B2B product
- Limited creative or storytelling component
- No clear role for Donovan's expertise
- **Recommendation:** No equity allocation for this venture

**Being Human Studio Brand (Medium Fit):**
- Thought leadership content for Kyle and BH team
- "Building the Future" narrative - venture studio behind-the-scenes
- Portfolio storytelling and brand positioning
- Valuable but overlaps with BHP corporate partnership deliverables

### Recommended Advisory Model

**Option 1: Studio Equity (Lower Range)**
- 0.35% studio equity
- Focus on strategic creative guidance across all ventures
- Quarterly creative strategy sessions
- Brand narrative development for BH studio
- Performance milestones tied to measurable brand/content impact

**Option 2: Venture-Specific Equity (Recommended)**
- WonderCast: 1.0% venture equity (creative is core product)
- Luminary: 1.25% venture equity (narrative design is core experience)
- Future media ventures: 0.5-2.0% based on creative contribution
- No studio equity (avoids overlap with BHP corporate partnership)

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- 0.25% studio equity (strategic brand guidance)
- Plus venture-specific equity for high-fit ventures (0.5-1.0% per venture)
- Combines portfolio-level creative vision with venture-specific contribution

**Recommended: Option 2 (Venture-Specific)**

Rationale:
- Avoids overlap with BHP corporate partnership (studio-level services)
- Aligns Donovan's incentives with ventures where he adds most value
- Reduces studio equity dilution
- Provides significant upside if his creative contributions drive venture success
- Clear separation: BHP delivers production services, Donovan provides strategic creative vision for specific ventures

## Comparison with Jocelyn Little

| Dimension | Donovan Chan | Jocelyn Little |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Primary Strength** | Creative direction, storytelling, content excellence | Operations, business development, platform relationships |
| **Network Focus** | Creative side: talent, directors, production partners | Business side: platforms, distributors, investors |
| **BH Constraint Fit** | Distribution (content creation) | Distribution + Deal Flow |
| **Studio-Level Value** | Lower (creative is being purchased via BHP partnership) | Higher (business development and strategic partnerships) |
| **Venture-Level Value** | Higher (creative vision for media ventures) | Medium (operational guidance) |
| **Overlap Risk** | Very high with BHP corporate partnership | High with BHP corporate partnership |

**Joint Advisory Consideration:**

The proposal suggests "Joc & Don" as joint advisors (0.5-1.0% combined). Given they're married co-founders with overlapping networks, a joint structure makes sense:

**Recommended Joint Structure:**
- **Combined Studio Equity:** 0.75% total (Jocelyn 0.4%, Donovan 0.35%)
- **Plus Venture-Specific:** Donovan gets additional venture equity for media ventures where creative contribution is core
- **Shared Milestones:** Some milestones require both to contribute (e.g., successful media industry partnership requires both business and creative excellence)
- **Individual Milestones:** Others are role-specific (Jocelyn: conversions; Donovan: creative deliverables)

This approach:
- Recognizes they share networks (married co-founders)
- Values their complementary expertise (business + creative)
- Avoids excessive dilution from overlapping value
- Provides upside for venture-specific creative contributions

## Next Steps

1. **Advisory Structure Decision** - Determine which approach:
   - Joint advisory with Jocelyn (recommended: 0.75% combined studio equity)
   - Separate advisors (0.35% Donovan, 0.4-0.75% Jocelyn)
   - Venture-specific equity for Donovan only (high-fit ventures)
   - Hybrid (small studio equity + venture-specific)

2. **Separation from BHP Corporate Partnership** - Clarify boundaries:
   - What creative services does BHP deliver as part of corporate partnership?
   - What strategic creative guidance does Donovan provide personally as advisor?
   - How to avoid double-paying for same creative expertise?
   - Can both relationships succeed independently?

3. **Venture-Specific Engagement** - If pursuing venture equity:
   - Define Donovan's role in WonderCast creative strategy (narrative design, content quality, platform positioning)
   - Scope Luminary creative vision work (world-building methodology, experiential storytelling)
   - Establish milestones tied to measurable creative impact

4. **Pilot Period** - Test working relationship before formalizing equity:
   - 6-month pilot: Donovan provides creative guidance on WonderCast launch
   - Evaluate: Does his strategic input go beyond what BHP provides corporately?
   - Decision: Proceed with equity advisory if value is clear and distinct from BHP partnership

5. **Fremantle Approval** - Ensure corporate parent approves:
   - External advisory work by Creative Director
   - Personal equity participation separate from BHP corporate relationship
   - No conflicts with Fremantle IP or production priorities

---

*Evaluation Confidence: High*
*Information Gaps:
- Unclear how much creative bandwidth Donovan has given Creative Director responsibilities
- Limited visibility into specific creative networks beyond production platforms
- No public information on Fremantle policies regarding external advisory roles for executives*
