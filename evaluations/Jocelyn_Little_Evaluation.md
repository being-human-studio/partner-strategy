# Partner Evaluation: Jocelyn Little

## Summary
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Partner** | Jocelyn Little, Managing Director & Co-Founder, Beach House Pictures |
| **Type** | Strategic Advisor / Deal & Capital Partner |
| **Evaluation Date** | February 1, 2026 |
| **Evaluator** | Claude + Kyle Jackson |

## Recommendation
**Score: 78/100** | **Tier: 2** | **Action: Strong Candidate - Active Pursuit**

Jocelyn Little brings exceptional credentials as a media industry executive with 20+ years experience building Asia's largest independent production company. Her Managing Director role encompasses operations, production, and business development - making her valuable across multiple BH constraints. The proposed 0.5-1.0% advisory equity is within range, though her primary value is likely in media/entertainment deal flow and distribution rather than capital or tech venture deal flow. Recommend positioning at mid-range (0.75%) with performance milestones tied to media industry introductions and BH brand elevation.

## Constraint Analysis

| Constraint | Fit Level | Evidence |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Capital Access | Indirect | Fremantle networks, media industry investors; not primary strength |
| Deal Flow | **Direct** | Deep media/entertainment relationships; potential to source media-tech convergence opportunities; Fremantle access opens strategic partnerships |
| Distribution/GTM | **Direct** | 20+ years building distribution relationships; Fremantle platform access; proven ability to navigate global streaming platforms (Netflix, Amazon) |

**Primary Constraints Solved:** Distribution/GTM + Deal Flow (media industry focus)

## Scoring Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Constraint Fit | 23/30 | Directly solves Distribution through media relationships and platform access; Deal flow limited to media/entertainment sector; Capital access indirect through Fremantle networks |
| Track Record | 20/25 | Exceptional - built VHQ TV over 7 years, co-founded and scaled Beach House Pictures to largest indie in Asia, Emmy-nominated productions, member of International Academy of TV Arts & Sciences |
| Network Quality | 16/20 | Strong media/entertainment network (Fremantle, Netflix, Amazon, broadcasters); Asian market depth; less clear on tech/AI investor networks which would benefit BH studio-level capital needs |
| Alignment | 12/15 | Strong interest in AI-media convergence (evidenced by partnership discussion); entrepreneurial mindset (built two production companies); some uncertainty on capacity given MD role at BHP + Fremantle integration demands |
| Availability | 7/10 | Significant commitments as MD of active production company; Fremantle integration likely consuming bandwidth; would need to carve out dedicated advisory time; responsive but not full-time available |
| **TOTAL** | **78/100** | |

## Recommended Structure

**Equity Type:** Studio Equity (horizontal value across BH portfolio)
**Equity Range:** 0.5% - 1.0% (per proposal)
**Recommended Allocation:** 0.75%
**Vesting:** 24 months with 6-month cliff (performance-gated)

### Rationale for 0.75% Mid-Range

**Why not higher (1.0%+):**
- Network strength is media/entertainment focused, less overlap with BH's primary tech/AI ecosystem needs
- Availability constraints due to MD role at BHP + Fremantle integration
- Track record exceptional in media but unproven in venture studio advisory context
- Would need to demonstrate conversion (introductions → signed engagements) before justifying top of range

**Why not lower (0.5% or below):**
- Exceptional operational track record (built two successful companies)
- Managing Director experience brings valuable business development and operational guidance
- Fremantle access provides distribution leverage that would take years to build
- Member of International Academy of TV Arts & Sciences signals industry credibility

**Mid-range positioning (0.75%) allows:**
- Test relationship at meaningful but not maximum equity commitment
- Room to increase if performance exceeds expectations (via acceleration triggers)
- Appropriate compensation for proven executive but unproven venture studio advisory value

### Performance-Gated Milestone Schedule

| Tranche | % of Total | Timeline | Milestone Trigger |
|---------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Cliff | 25% (0.1875%) | 6 months | 3 qualified introductions (media industry decision-makers) that result in meetings |
| T2 | 25% (0.1875%) | 12 months | 1 introduction converts to signed engagement (Foundation tier or venture partnership) OR BH brand presence established in media industry (speaking engagement, media coverage) |
| T3 | 25% (0.1875%) | 18 months | Cumulative 2 conversions OR $250K+ revenue from media industry opportunities sourced |
| T4 | 25% (0.1875%) | 24 months | Cumulative 3 conversions OR significant strategic partnership formalized (distribution, co-production, etc.) |

### Acceleration Triggers

- **Full acceleration (24-month vest → 12-month):** $500K+ revenue attributable to Jocelyn's introductions OR major distribution deal for BH venture (e.g., Fremantle distribution agreement for WonderCast or Luminary)
- **50% acceleration (24-month → 18-month):** 3 signed engagements within first 12 months

### Anti-Dilution and Conflict Management

**Fremantle Alignment:**
- Ensure clarity that advisory role is personal capacity, separate from Beach House Pictures corporate relationship
- No conflicts with Fremantle IP or exclusive production arrangements
- BH ventures that could compete with Fremantle content must be disclosed

**Beach House Pictures Corporate Partnership:**
- Advisory equity is separate from any corporate service exchange between BHP and BH
- If corporate partnership dissolves, advisory relationship can continue independently
- Clear separation: Jocelyn's equity vests based on personal contributions (introductions, guidance), not BHP's corporate deliverables

## Key Strengths

1. **Proven Company Builder** - Founded and scaled Beach House Pictures from startup to Asia's largest indie production company; previously built VHQ TV over 7 years; demonstrates ability to build and scale entertainment businesses

2. **Operational Excellence** - Managing Director role encompasses P&L, operations, business development, and production oversight; brings executive-level operational guidance valuable to BH venture operators

3. **Platform Relationships** - Direct relationships with Netflix, Amazon Prime, major streaming platforms; proven ability to navigate and close deals with global media companies

4. **Industry Credibility** - Member of International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences; serves on industry panels and boards; provides validation and credibility in media sector

5. **Asian Market Expertise** - 20+ years building media business in Singapore and across Asia; networks in SEA, China, Korea, Japan, India; valuable for BH's Asian market expansion

## Risk Factors

1. **Network Overlap with Corporate Partnership** - Jocelyn's primary networks (Fremantle, streaming platforms, broadcasters) are same networks Beach House Pictures brings in corporate partnership; risk of paying twice for same value
   - *Mitigation:* Clearly define Jocelyn's personal advisory contributions vs. BHP corporate deliverables; focus Jocelyn's milestones on introductions BHP wouldn't make in normal course of business (e.g., investor intros, non-competitive venture partnerships)

2. **Availability Constraints** - MD of active production company going through Fremantle integration; significant demands on time and attention; may struggle to prioritize BH advisory work
   - *Mitigation:* Set realistic expectations (quarterly check-ins, not weekly); milestone-based vesting means she only earns equity by delivering results; 6-month cliff provides opt-out if capacity proves insufficient

3. **Network Relevance Gap** - Strongest networks are media/entertainment; BH studio-level needs include tech investors, AI researchers, enterprise customers for ventures like Kavlo
   - *Mitigation:* Position Jocelyn as specialist advisor for media-adjacent ventures (WonderCast, Luminary, future entertainment ventures); supplement with other advisors for tech/enterprise focus

4. **Fremantle Conflict Risk** - Corporate parent may have policies restricting outside advisory roles; media industry deals could compete with Fremantle priorities
   - *Mitigation:* Require written confirmation from Fremantle that personal advisory role is approved; include disclosure and conflict resolution process in advisory agreement

5. **Unproven in Venture Studio Context** - Exceptional in production/media but no track record advising venture studios or early-stage tech companies
   - *Mitigation:* Performance-gated milestones mean she must prove ability to deliver in new context; mid-range equity positioning accounts for unproven track record; clear success metrics (conversions, not just intros)

### Strategic Fit with BH Ventures

**WonderCast (High Fit):**
- Parenting/storytelling content aligns with Jocelyn's lifestyle/entertainment production expertise
- Potential distribution conversations with streaming platforms
- Brand storytelling and positioning guidance
- Possible co-production or content licensing opportunities

**Luminary (High Fit):**
- Experiential education center has potential documentary/content angle
- "Learning futures" narrative could become media property
- Family entertainment expertise directly relevant
- Distribution pathways for any content produced

**Kavlo (Low Fit):**
- Enterprise B2B tool, outside Jocelyn's media/entertainment focus
- Limited network overlap with enterprise software buyers
- Operational guidance could be relevant but not domain-specific

**Future Media Ventures (Very High Fit):**
- Any BH ventures in media, entertainment, content, or creator economy would be perfect fit for Jocelyn's expertise
- Could help source and validate these opportunities before BH commits resources

### Advisory Engagement Model

- **Q1:** Introduction to BH portfolio, identification of overlap opportunities, first 2-3 introductions
- **Q2:** WonderCast launch support (media partnerships, distribution conversations), ongoing intros
- **Q3:** Luminary positioning and brand development, introduction targets for H2
- **Q4:** Performance review, strategic planning for Year 2

**Expected Deliverables:**
- 2-3 qualified introductions per quarter (8-12 annually)
- Quarterly strategy sessions with Kyle (1-2 hours)
- Ad-hoc guidance on media industry deals and partnerships (email/Slack support)
- Annual speaking engagement or thought leadership opportunity for BH brand

**NOT Expected:**
- Weekly time commitments
- Execution work (that's BH team's role)
- Technical or product guidance (outside expertise)
- Direct involvement in non-media ventures (unless specifically requested)

## Comparison with Donovan Chan

*Note: Donovan Chan is being evaluated separately, but comparison is useful since they're a couple and co-founders:*

| Dimension | Jocelyn Little | Donovan Chan |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Primary Strength** | Operations, business development, platform relationships | Creative direction, content production, storytelling |
| **Network Focus** | Business side: platforms, distributors, financiers | Creative side: talent, production partners, festivals |
| **BH Constraint Fit** | Distribution + Deal Flow | Distribution (content creation) |
| **Advisory Value** | Strategic partnerships, business models, operational scaling | Creative vision, content strategy, production quality |
| **Overlap Risk** | High (MD role overlaps with BHP corporate partnership) | High (Creative Director role overlaps with BHP corporate partnership) |

**Joint Advisory Consideration:**
The proposal suggests "Joc & Don" as joint advisors at 0.5-1.0% combined. This makes sense to avoid double-paying for overlapping networks, but also risks under-valuing if they bring complementary strengths:
- **Joint Advisory (0.75% total):** Recognize they share networks but bring different expertise
- **Split allocation:** Jocelyn 0.4%, Donovan 0.35% to reflect Jocelyn's MD/business development focus being slightly more relevant to BH studio operations

Alternatively:
- **Individual advisors:** Evaluate separately, risk paying for overlapping networks
- **Couple deal:** 1.0% combined, structured as joint advisory with both contributing to shared milestones

## Next Steps

1. **Clarity Discussion** - Align on role expectations and deliverables
   - Is this joint advisory with Donovan or separate roles?
   - What are realistic time commitments given MD responsibilities?
   - How does personal advisory role separate from BHP corporate partnership?
   - Has Fremantle approved external advisory work?

2. **Network Mapping** - Understand specific relationships Jocelyn can activate
   - Which platform decision-makers can she introduce BH to?
   - What media industry investors or partners should BH meet?
   - Are there specific opportunities in her pipeline that could become BH ventures?

3. **Pilot Period** - Consider 6-month pilot before formalizing equity
   - Test working relationship and communication style
   - Validate that introductions lead to productive conversations
   - Confirm availability and responsiveness meet BH needs
   - Decision point: Proceed with equity advisory or restructure relationship

4. **Advisory Agreement** - If proceeding, formalize terms
   - Equity allocation: 0.75% studio equity (or joint structure with Donovan)
   - Performance-gated milestones tied to conversions, not just introductions
   - Conflict of interest and Fremantle approval documentation
   - Quarterly deliverables and communication cadence
   - Separation from BHP corporate partnership (both can succeed independently)

---

*Evaluation Confidence: High*
*Information Gaps:
- No public disclosure of Fremantle policies on outside advisory work (need to confirm approval)
- Limited visibility into specific investor or strategic partner relationships beyond production platforms
- Unclear how much bandwidth she realistically has given MD role + Fremantle integration*
