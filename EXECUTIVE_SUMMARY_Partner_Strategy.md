## What We've Created

A complete partner evaluation and cap table management system for Being Human, consisting of:

1. **Updated Beach House Deal Structure** - Service-for-equity exchange model
2. **Cap Table Strategy Framework** - 15-20% Growth Pool allocation strategy
3. **Partner Evaluation Framework** - Standardized 5-dimension scoring system
4. **Pipeline Tracking Spreadsheet** - Collaborative tool for team decision-making

**Goal:** Enable BH team to rapidly evaluate, rank, and prioritize partner opportunities while maintaining strategic cap table discipline.

## Critical Decisions Required

### Decision 1: Beach House Pictures Deal Structure

**Their Request:**
- Jocelyn & Donovan: 5% combined personal advisory equity
- BHP Corporate: Storyteller services in exchange for equity

**Our Analysis:**
- 5% consumes 25-33% of total Growth Pool (15-20%)
- Limits ability to bring in tech advisors, capital partners, enterprise distribution
- Significant network overlap (married co-founders, 90% shared networks)
- Primarily solve Distribution (#3 constraint), not Capital or Deal Flow (#1-2 constraints)

**Our Recommendation:**

| Element | Proposed | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **BHP Corporate** | 2.5% equity for storytelling services (S$400K value) | Emmy-level production, Fremantle leverage, fills media gap |
| **Jocelyn Personal** | 0.4% studio equity (vs. 2.5% requested) | Strategic advisor range, accounts for overlap with BHP |
| **Donovan Personal** | 0% studio / 1.0-1.5% per media venture | Creative value overlaps with BHP; offer venture-specific instead |
| **TOTAL BHP-Related** | 2.9% studio + venture-specific | vs. 7.5% if accept full request |

**Counter-Offer Talking Points:**
> "We value your expertise tremendously. To build a complete partner portfolio solving all our constraints (capital, deal flow, distribution), we need to allocate equity strategically. We're offering 2.5% for BHP corporate storytelling services plus 0.4% personal advisory for Jocelyn. For Donovan, we'd like to offer significant venture-specific equity in WonderCast and Luminary where his creative vision is most impactful. This structure gives you meaningful upside while preserving our ability to bring in tech advisors, investor networks, and other critical partners."

**If They Insist on 5%:**
- Option A: Performance-based earnout (2.5% base + 2.5% if exceptional milestones hit)
- Option B: Decline gracefully and prioritize tech/capital partners instead
- Option C: Accept 3.5% combined (compromise) but recognize this limits other partnerships

**Recommended Action:** Counter at 2.9% total (2.5% BHP + 0.4% Jocelyn + venture-specific Donovan)

### Decision 2: Cap Table Allocation Strategy

**Growth Pool Budget:** 15-20% total studio equity for partners/advisors

**Recommended Allocation:**

| Partner Type | # Needed | Target % | Priority | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Strategic Advisors** | 4-6 | 4-6% | **HIGH** | 0% allocated |
| **Deal & Capital Partners** | 3-5 | 3-5% | **HIGH** | ~0.5% (Gay pending) |
| **Domain Experts** | 2-3 | 2-3% | **MEDIUM** | 0% allocated |
| **GTM & Distribution** | 2-3 | 3-4% | **MEDIUM** | ~2.5% (BHP proposed) |
| **Brand & Storytelling** | 1-2 | 1-2% | **LOW** | ~2.5% (BHP proposed) |
| **Reserve** | - | 2-3% | - | Unallocated |
| **TOTAL** | **15-20** | **15-20%** | | **~5.5% allocated** |

**Key Insight:**
- BH's #1 constraint = Capital Access (investors, LPs)
- BH's #2 constraint = Deal Flow (venture opportunities)
- BH's #3 constraint = Distribution/GTM

Beach House primarily solves #3. Need to prioritize equity for partners solving #1 and #2.

**Recommended Sequencing (Next 24 Months):**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6):**
1. Tech/AI Strategic Advisor (1.0%) - Capital access via AI investor networks
2. Capital Partner #1 - Anchor ($250K+ investment) (1.25%)
3. Beach House (2.9%) - Distribution/GTM via media

**Phase 2 (Months 7-12):**
4. Capital Partner #2 ($100-250K) (1.0%)
5. Enterprise GTM Partner (1.25%) - B2B distribution for Kavlo
6. Industry Strategic Advisor (0.75%)

**Phase 3 (Months 13-24):**
7. Capital Partner #3 (0.75%)
8. Strategic Advisor - Capital Focus (0.75%)
9. Domain Expert - Education (0.75%)

**Total 24-Month Allocation: ~9% studio equity** (preserves 6-11% for future)

**Recommended Action:** Approve phased allocation strategy, prioritize capital/tech partners

### Decision 3: Team Evaluation System Implementation

**What's Needed:**

1. **Adopt Evaluation Framework** - Standardized 5-dimension scoring (Constraint Fit, Track Record, Network, Uniqueness, Availability)
2. **Set Up Tracking Spreadsheet** - Google Sheets template provided, needs team access
3. **Assign Evaluation Responsibilities** - Who evaluates which types of partners
4. **Schedule Regular Reviews** - Weekly partner pipeline review (15 min in Monday sync)

**Roles & Responsibilities:**

| Team Member | Primary Responsibility | Secondary Responsibility |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Kyle** | Final approval on all equity decisions | Tech/AI advisor evaluations |
| **Steve** | Capital partner evaluations | Strategic advisor evaluations |
| **Ram** | Domain expert evaluations | GTM partner evaluations |
| **Jaden** | Brand/content partner evaluations | Research support for all |

**Weekly Process:**
1. **New additions** - Any team member can add partner to pipeline
2. **Research & score** - Assigned evaluator completes within 1 week
3. **Team review** - Discuss partners scoring 75+ in Monday sync
4. **Decision** - Kyle approves/defers/declines with team input
5. **Next steps** - Owner assigned for outreach or documentation

**Recommended Action:** Set up Google Sheet, assign team roles, add to Monday agenda

## Common Questions

### Q: What if a partner doesn't fit the framework?

**A:** Use the framework as a guide, not a straitjacket. For unusual opportunities (e.g., strategic corporate partner, unique IP licensing deal), document why you're deviating from framework and what makes it exceptional.

### Q: Can we give equity outside the Growth Pool?

**A:** Yes, but be strategic. Venture-specific equity (for operators, domain experts on specific ventures) comes from venture cap table, not studio Growth Pool. Employee equity comes from options pool.

### Q: What if we run out of Growth Pool budget?

**A:** Either (1) raise more capital and dilute everyone proportionally, freeing up equity, or (2) be more selective - only pursue 85+ partners, decline 60-74 tier.

### Q: How do we handle referrals from existing partners?

**A:** Evaluate using same framework. Don't give equity just because a partner referred them. But do give credit - if referral converts, counts toward existing partner's milestones.

### Q: What about revenue share vs. equity?

**A:** GTM & Distribution partners can receive revenue share instead of equity (15-25% of revenue from their channel). Good for performance-pure alignment. Brand partners can get project fees + smaller equity stake.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Over-Allocation Too Early

**Risk:** Give away too much equity (>15%) in first 6 months, limiting future flexibility

**Mitigation:**
- Phase allocation over 24 months
- Keep 6-11% reserve for opportunistic partnerships
- Performance-gate all equity (earn through milestones)
- Can always give more equity; can't take it back

### Risk 2: Network Overlap

**Risk:** Multiple partners with same networks, paying multiple times for same introductions

**Mitigation:**
- Score Uniqueness dimension carefully (0-15 points)
- Check overlap before approving each partner
- Reduce allocation by 25-50% if overlap detected
- Track in spreadsheet (Similar Partners column)

### Risk 3: Under-Delivery by Partners

**Risk:** Partners don't deliver value, but already vested equity

**Mitigation:**
- Performance-gated milestones for ALL partners
- No time-based vesting without deliverables
- 6-month cliff before any equity vests
- Can terminate and forfeit unvested equity if not delivering

### Risk 4: Team Misalignment

**Risk:** Team evaluates partners inconsistently, makes conflicting recommendations

**Mitigation:**
- Standardized evaluation framework (all use same scorecard)
- Weekly pipeline review for alignment
- Kyle has final approval on all decisions
- Document rationale for each decision in spreadsheet

### Risk 5: Opportunity Cost

**Risk:** Pursue wrong partners, miss better opportunities

**Mitigation:**
- Score all opportunities before pursuing
- Only pursue 85+ aggressively, be selective on 75-84
- Review pipeline weekly to reprioritize
- Defer < 75 partners to preserve capacity
