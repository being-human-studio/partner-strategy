# Partner Evaluation Framework - Team Guide
## How Being Human Team Evaluates, Ranks, and Prioritizes Partner Opportunities

**Purpose:** Ensure all BH team members evaluate partners consistently using same criteria
**Users:** Kyle, Steve, Ram, Jaden, and any team member assessing potential partners

---

## Quick Reference

### When to Use This Framework

✅ **Use for:**
- Strategic advisors (offering or requesting equity)
- Investors/capital partners
- Domain experts for specific ventures
- Distribution/GTM partners
- Brand/content partners
- Anyone asking for equity or offering strategic value

❌ **Don't use for:**
- Service providers (agencies, consultants paid cash)
- Employees (use hiring framework instead)
- Vendors/suppliers
- One-time transactions

### Evaluation Process (5 Steps)

1. **Gather Information** - Research partner background, networks, track record
2. **Score on 5 Dimensions** - Use standardized scorecard (see below)
3. **Classify Partner Type** - Determine which BH constraint they solve
4. **Compare Against Portfolio** - Evaluate overlap with existing partners
5. **Recommend Action** - Pursue, defer, or pass with allocation recommendation

**Time Required:** 30-60 minutes per partner evaluation

---

## Step 1: Gather Information

### Required Information Checklist

Before scoring, collect:

**Professional Background:**
- [ ] Current role and company
- [ ] Previous roles (last 10 years)

- 🚩 Pressure tactics or urgency without justification

**Time Investment:** 20-30 minutes of research per partner

---

## Step 2: Score on 5 Dimensions

Use this standardized scorecard for every partner evaluation.

### Scoring Framework (0-100 Total)

| Dimension | Weight | Range | What We're Measuring |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------------------|
| **Constraint Fit** | 30% | 0-30 | How directly do they solve Capital, Deal Flow, or Distribution? |
| **Track Record** | 25% | 0-25 | Evidence of past success in similar partnerships |
| **Network Quality** | 20% | 0-20 | Relevance and depth of relationships to BH needs |
| **Uniqueness** | 15% | 0-15 | Do they bring something we don't have? Or overlap with existing partners? |
| **Availability** | 10% | 0-10 | Actual capacity to contribute given other commitments |

---

### Dimension 1: Constraint Fit (0-30 points)

**Core Question:** Does this partner directly solve one of BH's three constraints?

**BH's Three Constraints (in priority order):**
1. **Capital Access** - Funding, investors, LP relationships
2. **Deal Flow** - Venture opportunities, partnership leads
3. **Distribution/GTM** - Customer access, market channels

**Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **25-30** | Directly solves primary constraint with proven mechanism; can articulate exactly how they'll deliver | LP who has committed capital to similar studios; advisor who sourced 3+ deals that closed in last year; distribution partner with active customer relationships |
| **18-24** | Solves constraint but mechanism less proven; logical path exists but unproven in BH context | Former executive at target customer company (but hasn't made intros yet); investor with relevant portfolio (but hasn't sourced deals for studios before) |
| **10-17** | Partial fit or secondary benefit; tangential connection to constraint | Marketing executive (could help brand but not primary constraint); technical advisor (valuable but doesn't solve Capital/Deal Flow/Distribution) |
| **0-9** | No clear constraint fit; "nice to have" relationship without leverage | Cannot articulate path to solving any constraint; value proposition vague or aspirational |

**How to Score:**
1. Ask partner: "Which of BH's constraints (Capital, Deal Flow, Distribution) do you primarily solve?"
2. Request evidence: "Can you give specific examples of how you've delivered this for others?"
3. Validate mechanism: "Walk me through exactly how you'd activate your network for BH"
4. Assign score based on directness and proof

**Example:**
- Partner claims to solve Capital Access
- Has LP relationships at 3 venture funds
- Made 5 investor intros in last year, 2 converted to investments
- Can name specific people they'd introduce BH to
- **Score: 27/30** (direct fit, proven mechanism, recent track record)

---

### Dimension 2: Track Record (0-25 points)

**Core Question:** Do they have documented success in similar partnership contexts?

**Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Description | Evidence to Look For |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **20-25** | Documented success with measurable outcomes; references available; consistent delivery pattern | Named deals/investments they sourced; revenue attributed to their contributions; companies they've scaled; verifiable testimonials |
| **14-19** | Relevant experience with mixed or unclear results; some success but limited sample size | General career success in relevant domain; anecdotal evidence of contributions; partial attribution in team successes |
| **7-13** | Limited relevant track record; new to advisory roles but career trajectory suggests capability | Transferable skills from other contexts; potential but unproven; early in advisory career |
| **0-6** | No relevant experience or negative signals; failed partnerships or pattern of under-delivery | No partnership experience; negative references; over-promised and under-delivered previously |

**How to Score:**
1. Request specific examples: "What similar partnerships have you had? What were the outcomes?"
2. Ask for references: "Can you connect me with 2-3 people you've advised or partnered with?"
3. Verify claims: Search for evidence of their contributions (press releases, case studies, LinkedIn recommendations)
4. Look for patterns: Consistent success or one-off flukes?

**Example:**
- Partner advised 3 startups in last 5 years
- One exited for $50M (they helped with investor intros)
- One raised Series A (they opened doors to lead investor)
- One failed to gain traction (market timing, not their fault)
- Can provide references from 2 founders
- **Score: 22/25** (proven track record, verifiable outcomes, references available)

---

### Dimension 3: Network Quality (0-20 points)

**Core Question:** Do they have deep, current relationships with people/organizations BH needs to reach?

**Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **16-20** | Deep, relevant relationships with direct access; current and active (engaged last 6 months); can make warm intros | Can name specific people and context of relationship; has made intros for others recently; reciprocal relationships (they reach out to partner too); social evidence of real engagement |
| **11-15** | Good network with some relevance gaps; strong network in general but may need to build bridges to most valuable nodes | General industry connectivity; some relevant contacts but not comprehensive; may need to reactivate relationships; network better in some areas than others |
| **6-10** | Network relevance unclear; exists but mapping to BH needs uncertain; may be different industry/geography | Network in related but not exact domain; relationships may be superficial; would require discovery to assess value |
| **0-5** | Limited or irrelevant network; small professional network or unrelated domains | Early career or isolated work history; network wouldn't help BH priorities |

**How to Score:**
1. Ask for network map: "Who are the top 5 people you'd introduce BH to in first 6 months?"
2. Assess currency: "When did you last interact with each of them?"
3. Verify depth: "What's the context of your relationship? How would they respond to your intro?"
4. Check proof: LinkedIn connections, social media engagement, public evidence of relationships

**Example:**
- Partner has relationships with 3 venture fund partners (can name them)
- Introduced another startup to Fund A 6 months ago (resulted in investment)
- Quarterly dinners with Fund B partner (personal friendship)
- Fund C partner is former colleague (strong relationship)
- LinkedIn shows mutual connections and engagement
- **Score: 18/20** (deep, current, relevant relationships with proof of activation)

---

### Dimension 4: Uniqueness (0-15 points)

**Core Question:** Do they bring networks/expertise we don't already have, or do they overlap with existing partners?

**Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Description | Assessment |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **12-15** | Highly unique; fills gap in BH's current partner portfolio; brings networks/expertise no other partner has | Zero overlap with existing partners; addresses unmet need; differentiated value proposition |
| **8-11** | Moderately unique; some overlap but also brings new networks or perspective | 30-50% overlap with existing partners; complementary rather than redundant |
| **4-7** | Low uniqueness; significant overlap with existing partners; some incremental value | 50-80% overlap; mostly duplicates existing relationships; marginal additional value |
| **0-3** | No uniqueness; complete overlap with existing partners; no new value | 80%+ overlap; same networks, same expertise, same constraint solution as current partners |

**How to Score:**
1. Compare to existing partners: Review current BH partner list
2. Map networks: Do their relationships overlap with partners we have?
3. Assess expertise: Do they bring domain knowledge we lack?
4. Identify gaps: What can they do that no current partner can?

**Uniqueness Matrix:**

| Overlap % | Uniqueness Score | Action |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| 0-20% | 12-15 | High priority - fills gap |
| 20-50% | 8-11 | Moderate priority - complementary |
| 50-80% | 4-7 | Low priority - redundant |
| 80-100% | 0-3 | Defer - complete overlap |

**Example:**
- BH currently has media/entertainment partner (Beach House Pictures)
- New partner is also in media/entertainment (80% network overlap)
- But brings sports media relationships (BHP doesn't have)
- **Score: 6/15** (mostly redundant but some unique sports angle)

---

### Dimension 5: Availability (0-10 points)

**Core Question:** Do they realistically have capacity to contribute given other commitments?

**Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **8-10** | Clear capacity; BH would be among top 3 priorities; responsive and committed | Limited advisory roles (<3); between roles or transitioning; explicitly prioritizing BH-type work; responsive in initial conversations |
| **5-7** | Available with competing commitments; generally reliable but not always fast | 3-5 current advisory roles; full-time role but manageable load; states they can make time; reasonable responsiveness |
| **2-4** | Limited availability; concerns about follow-through; already stretched | 5+ advisory roles; demanding full-time role; slow to respond; hedges on time commitments |
| **0-1** | Overcommitted; cannot realistically add BH; would be equity dilution without contribution | Cannot credibly add BH to current load; history of ghosting or under-delivering; already stretched too thin |

**How to Score:**
1. Ask directly: "What other advisory roles or commitments do you have?"
2. Test responsiveness: How quickly do they reply to emails/messages?
3. Assess realism: Does their time commitment match their other obligations?
4. Check LinkedIn: How many "Advisor" roles are listed?

**Red Flags:**
- 🚩 More than 5 advisory roles listed
- 🚩 Takes >3 days to respond to initial outreach
- 🚩 Can't commit to specific time (e.g., "quarterly calls")
- 🚩 Full-time executive role at fast-growing company (no bandwidth)

**Example:**
- Partner has 2 other advisory roles
- Founder-level time commitment at their own startup (full-time)
- Responded to BH outreach within 24 hours
- Offered to commit 4 hours/month to BH
- **Score: 6/10** (available but competing commitments)

---

### Calculating Total Score

Add all dimension scores:

**Example Calculation:**
- Constraint Fit: 27/30
- Track Record: 22/25
- Network Quality: 18/20
- Uniqueness: 12/15
- Availability: 6/10
- **TOTAL: 85/100**

## Step 4: Classify Partner Type

Every partner should map to one primary type (and optionally one secondary):

### Partner Type Definitions

| Type | Primary Constraint Solved | Typical Score Profile | Equity Range |
|------|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Strategic Advisor** | Deal Flow + Capital Access | High on Track Record & Network Quality | 0.5-1.5% studio |
| **Deal & Capital Partner** | Capital Access (primary) | High on Constraint Fit & Track Record | 0.5-1.5% studio + investment |
| **Domain Expert** | Deal Flow (validation) + Distribution (customers) | High on Constraint Fit & Uniqueness | 0.5-2% venture |
| **Venture Operator** | Execution (enables all constraints) | High on Track Record & Availability | 5-15% venture |
| **GTM & Distribution** | Distribution/GTM (primary) | High on Constraint Fit & Network Quality | 1-2% studio or 2-20% venture |
| **Brand & Storytelling** | Distribution (awareness) + Deal Flow (positioning) | High on Track Record & Uniqueness | 0.25-1% studio or 1-3% venture |

### Classification Decision Tree

```
What constraint do they primarily solve?

1. Capital Access → Are they investing money?
   ├─ YES → Deal & Capital Partner
   └─ NO → Strategic Advisor (if also brings deal flow)

2. Deal Flow → Do they source venture opportunities?
   ├─ Broad deal flow → Strategic Advisor
   └─ Domain-specific validation → Domain Expert

3. Distribution/GTM → What type of distribution?
   ├─ Customer channels → GTM & Distribution Partner
   └─ Brand/content → Brand & Storytelling Partner

4. Execution → Are they operating a venture?
   └─ YES → Venture Operator
```

---

## Step 5: Compare Against Portfolio & Recommend Action

### Portfolio Check

Before recommending pursuit, check:

1. **How many partners of this type do we already have?**
   - Strategic Advisors: Target 4-6, currently have ___
   - Deal & Capital: Target 3-5, currently have ___
   - Domain Experts: Target 2-3, currently have ___
   - GTM & Distribution: Target 2-3, currently have ___
   - Brand & Storytelling: Target 1-2, currently have ___

2. **Do they overlap with existing partners?**
   - Check Uniqueness score (<8 = high overlap)
   - If high overlap, are they significantly better than existing partner?
   - Can we afford both, or should we choose?

3. **What equity budget remains?**
   - Total Growth Pool: 15-20%
   - Already allocated: ___ %
   - Remaining: ___ %
   - Does this partner fit within remaining budget?

4. **What's our priority right now?**
   - Capital Access (highest priority) → Prioritize investors and LP networks
   - Deal Flow (high priority) → Prioritize strategic advisors and domain experts
   - Distribution (medium priority) → Prioritize GTM partners

### Recommendation Framework

Use this decision matrix:

| Score | Portfolio Fit | Budget Available | Recommendation |
|-------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| 85+ | Fills gap, low overlap | Yes | **PURSUE AGGRESSIVELY** - Top of range allocation, fast-track |
| 85+ | Some overlap | Yes | **PURSUE** - Standard allocation, but monitor overlap |
| 85+ | High overlap | Yes | **COMPARE** - Only pursue if better than existing partner |
| 85+ | Any | No | **DEFER** - Wait until budget available or deprioritize lower-tier partners |
| 75-84 | Fills gap, low overlap | Yes | **PURSUE** - Standard allocation |
| 75-84 | Some overlap | Yes | **PURSUE (Cautiously)** - Mid-to-lower range allocation |
| 75-84 | High overlap | Yes | **DEFER** - Only if existing partner isn't delivering |
| 75-84 | Any | No | **DEFER** - Revisit when budget available |
| 60-74 | Fills gap | Yes | **QUALIFIED** - Lower range, test relationship first |
| 60-74 | Any overlap | Yes | **WATCHLIST** - Revisit if circumstances improve |
| 60-74 | Any | No | **PASS** - Below threshold for limited budget |
| <60 | Any | Any | **PASS** - Does not meet minimum standard |

## Equity Allocation Guidelines

### Base Allocation by Type & Tier

| Partner Type | Tier 1 (85+) | Tier 2 (75-84) | Tier 3 (60-74) |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Strategic Advisor** | 1.0-1.5% | 0.5-1.0% | 0.25-0.5% |
| **Deal & Capital Partner** | 1.0-1.5% + investment | 0.5-1.0% + investment | 0.25-0.5% + investment |
| **Domain Expert (Studio)** | 1.0-1.5% | 0.5-1.0% | 0.25-0.5% |
| **GTM & Distribution** | 1.5-2.0% | 1.0-1.5% | 0.5-1.0% |
| **Brand & Storytelling** | 0.75-1.0% | 0.5-0.75% | 0.25-0.5% |

### Adjustment Factors

**Increase allocation by 25-50% if:**
- ✅ Solves multiple constraints (e.g., capital + deal flow)
- ✅ Bringing capital in addition to strategic value
- ✅ Taking significant risk (leaving role, exclusive commitment)
- ✅ Exceptional uniqueness (fills critical gap no one else can)

**Decrease allocation by 25-50% if:**
- ⚠️ Significant overlap with existing partners (Uniqueness <8)
- ⚠️ Unproven in venture studio context (Track Record <15)
- ⚠️ Limited availability (Availability <5)
- ⚠️ Testing relationship (first engagement)

### Example Allocation Decision

**Partner Profile:**
- Type: Strategic Advisor
- Score: 82/100 (Tier 2)
- Overlap: Low (Uniqueness 13/15)
- Solves: Capital Access + Deal Flow

**Base Allocation:** 0.5-1.0% (Tier 2 Strategic Advisor)

**Adjustments:**
- +25% for solving two constraints (capital + deal flow)
- +0% for uniqueness (already strong at 13/15)

**Final Allocation:** 0.75-1.25% (mid-to-upper range)

**Recommended Offer:** 1.0% studio equity

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't:

1. **Score based on likeability** - Score objective criteria, not personal chemistry
2. **Overweight credentials** - Past success ≠ future value to BH
3. **Ignore overlap** - Multiple partners with same networks = wasted equity
4. **Rush evaluation** - Take time to research and validate claims
5. **Let partners self-score** - What they think they bring ≠ what they actually bring
6. **Give equity for "potential"** - Performance-gate everything
7. **Forget opportunity cost** - Every 1% to Partner A is 1% not available for Partner B

### ✅ Do:

1. **Be objective** - Use data, evidence, references
2. **Validate claims** - Don't take their word for network/track record
3. **Compare alternatives** - Is this the best use of this equity?
4. **Check portfolio fit** - Do we need this type of partner right now?
5. **Performance-gate** - Earn equity through milestones, not promises
6. **Preserve flexibility** - Don't over-allocate early
7. **Think holistically** - Build complete partner portfolio, not individual deals

- **Recommendation: PURSUE** - 2.5% equity for services OR corporate service exchange

**Jocelyn:**
- Some overlap: With BHP corporate + Donovan (Uniqueness 8/15)
- Tier 3 score: Suggests lower range allocation
- **Recommendation: PURSUE (Cautiously)** - 0.4-0.5% studio equity, not 2.5%

**Donovan:**
- High overlap: 90%+ with BHP corporate + Jocelyn (Uniqueness 6/15)
- Creative value being purchased via BHP already
- **Recommendation: DEFER** - Venture-specific equity only (WonderCast/Luminary)

**Combined Package:**
- BHP Corporate: 2.5% (service exchange)
- Jocelyn: 0.4%
- Donovan: 0% studio (1-1.5% per media venture)
- **Total Studio Dilution: 2.9%** (vs. 7.5% if accepted 5% request)
